5 Health Benefits of 3D-Wave™ Massage Technology


Some might shy away at the mention of massage or make a remark about motels and quarters. Here are 5 proven health benefits that our massage function can provide.


1. Fall asleep faster


Massage is a good option if you're looking for a natural pill-free approach to better sleep: 57% of participants in a Michigan State University study found that the 30-Wave massage helped them fall asleep more easily


2. Increase circulation


3D-Wave Massage is like an ocean with waves-it utilizes resonant frequency to create a circular motion that stimulates blood flow. This option is great for mornings helping to get the blood flowing after a night of rest and immobility.


3. Stick to a bedtime routine


One of the best ways to improve your sleep is to stick to a consistent sleep schedule With Reverie, you can automatically set a timer for a massage before bed while you watch your favorite show or read a book. After 30 minutes, the massage shuts off and cues you to turn off the lights-the perfect wind-down routine


4. Have more energy during the day


In the MSU study, the majority of participants reported a better mood upon waking up and more daytime alertness, rating 35% higher than those who did not use the massage prior to sleep


5. Relieve sore muscles and swelling


The combination of raising the feet and turning on massage is great for those who stand on their feet all day.


experience swollen feet, or anyone who is a frequent exerciser 47% of study participants found relief for sore muscles, and raising the feet above the heart is quick and easy relief for swollen feet and ankles


These health benefits, combined with a whisper-quiet motor, make Reverie's 3D-Wave™ Massage the perfect solution for those looking to enhance the comfort of their bed and the value of their sleep.

7 Simple Steps to a Perfect Power Base Presentation


As recommended by froverie


1. Begin by elevating the foot of the base to relieve pressure from the lower body.


Ask the customer if it's okay to elevate their feet. Tell them to notify you when they're comfortable. Point out the pressure relief they are experiencing on their lower back, legs, and feet. This is ideal for people that are on their feet all day, very active/athletic, and those with lower back injuries.


2. Elevate the head of the power base.


Again, ask the customer to tell you when they are comfortable. Inform them that they will feel even more pressure coming off of their lower back. This is also a great time to explain that the remote has buttons for preset positions and programmable positions.


3. Add 3D-Wave massage at a low intensity to the foot of the base.


Share that Reverie's 3D-Wave massage is meant to enhance the sleep experience. It is soothing and improves circulation and relaxation. Pont out that there are buttons on the remote to control the head and foot massage independently along with different wave modes or massage patterns.


4. Press the flat preset.


Ask the customer to notice the pressure returning to their lower back, the stretching and pulling. Once flat ask them which position they prefer


5. Anti-Snore test.


Ask the customer to take three deep breaths while lying flat. Then press the Anti-Snore preset.


Ask them to take another three deep breaths. Ask if they notice a difference in breathing. Slightly elevating the head opens the airways and can alleviate snoring. This is also a great position for colds, allergies, and people with acid reflux.


6. Press the Zero Gravity preset.


Explain that this is a preset position ideal for taking pressure off the lower back, it promotes circulation and is helpful with healing, recovery, and more restful sleep. If the customer does not feel that they can sleep in this position explain that it's great for relaxing prior to sleep.


7. Demonstrate Reverie Nightstand app feature.


This is a great time to mention the benefits of Bluetooth if the power base is equipped with it. Bluetooth will allow the customer to control the bed using the free Reverie Nightstand app, which gives them access to additional features and unlimited customizable settings.
