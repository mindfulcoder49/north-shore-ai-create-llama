SLEEP INSIGHTS


Good sleep can improve concentration and productivity.


You are 4X MORE LIKELY to suffer from lack of concentration if you are not getting the recommended amount of sleep. Sleep is important for various aspects of brain function including cognition, concentration, productivity, and performance.


Sleep improves your immune function.


Even a small loss of sleep has been shown to impair immune function. Those who sleep less than 7 hours are almost 3 TIMES more likely to develop a cold than those who slept 8 hours or more.


Good sleep can maximize athletic performance.


Whether it's a quick morning jog or an extended day at the gym, sleep has been shown to enhance physical performance when compared to those who are not getting quality sleep.

Americans suffer from a sleep-related issue. Along with nutrition and exercise, quality sleep is one of the three pillars of health.


Below are just some of the ways that poor sleep can affect your life and your health.


Poor sleep is linked to higher body weight. If you're trying to lose weight, getting quality sleep is absolutely crucial.


Greater risk of heart disease and stroke. A review of 15 studies found that people who don't get enough sleep are at far greater risk of heart disease or stroke than those who sleep 7-8 hours per night.


Greater risk of Type 2 diabetes. Those sleeping less than 6 hours per night have repeatedly been shown to be at an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.


Poor sleep is linked to depression. It's been estimated that 90% of people with depression complain about sleep quality.


Sleep affects emotions and social interactions. Researchers believe that poor sleep affects your ability to recognize important social cues and process emotional information.


TEMPUR-PEDIC SETUP


SETUP TIME


Give yourself a few minutes! The longer, the better.


Set the expectation of discovery. "Give me three minutes to see if this technology is right for you."


LET THEM KNOW THAT THE EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT


Manage a feel "reaction."


As they lie down, manage a feel reaction by saying. "This may feel a little bit different than what you're used to. As you lie down, the material adapts to your body to provide a feel that's totally unique to you."


DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENCE IN REAL TIME


Describe what the customer is experiencing and tell them why it's important.


"You should feel the material softening around your shoulders, providing pressure relief where you need it most. As you roll onto your back or side, you'll feel the


material filling into your lower back, providing support so your muscles can relax."


FILL THEM IN ON EXCLUSIVE TEMPUR-ADAPT TECHNOLOGY


It's what's inside that matters.


"Only TEMPUR® Material has TEMPUR-Adapt Technology. TEMPUR Material is a personalized material that softens where you want it, for deep levels of pressure relief. and remains firmer where you need it, for high levels of support. It absorbs energy and reduces motion transfer, so you barely feel your partner move."


IF THEY LIKE THE TECHNOLOGY, THEN SELECT THE FEEL Every Tempur-Pedic mattress has TEMPUR-Adapt Technology.


Explain that all Tempur-Pedics provide a personalized experience as they adapt to their body's weight, shape, and temperature. If they love what the material does, all they need to do is pick out the right collection.
