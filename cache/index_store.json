There are many reasons to find Large Language Models, or LLMs, like chatGPT, captivating, but for me I think what I like so much is the helpfulness. It can be unwise to universalize, but I think we all find people can be less than forthcoming with their more useful secrets. Knowledge is power after all. So after the initial shock of encountering an application that can speak so convincingly, the lasting impact for me is its constant unwavering dedication to being helpful. It's just math of course, but it becomes a human interaction that challenges us to see how often our own responses are constrained by priorities other than responsiveness. I think LLMs represent a real dedication to open data and information, and I think that is actually one of the most disruptive things about them. LLMs will give their best answer to anyone and do not ask you first \"What is your background? \" before deciding whether and how to answer your question. I used to work on academic library software, and the most important thing that software does is check if the user is logged in, or using an on campus IP address, and only then provide access to all the online journal subscriptions for that educational institution.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ea5befba-0280-452f-9b58-fadc79af2f79":{"id_":"ea5befba-0280-452f-9b58-fadc79af2f79","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cb6728a6-2274-401a-a126-a099da9be105","metadata":{},"hash":"twOyxK9hVRsIhdVdzS3rboM7+FYawuVF2JlzTkCkMyo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c1a7b704-bf98-43ee-87af-ee201a14482f","metadata":{},"hash":"cjCfZ+3DZjVz8btPf2ZxlztVqjgwNoFix7tFIdNobHs="}},"hash":"X31IojphE9YTm31efyNNYJmZLbGzaXkqnbGTmLiZn44=","text":"Despite the vast internet, knowledge was still very difficult to access.

It had been a long time since I had dedicated myself to learning anything new related to computer science, but I, like many, was entranced by the speech capabilities of ChatGPT, and I wanted to know more. By searching the internet I found one group, which led me to the next and the next, until I was running my own meetups for a global AI education startup, and then creating this, a guide to AI for everyone. There are many guides to AI out there, and there will be many more written. Ironically, the safest space for writers looking to outcompete Large Language Models like ChatGPT might be to write about them. However, this book is not only about Large Language Models, but also about the various people affected by them and what I’ve seen happening in the last six months. This book is one picture, and one set of suggestions, but it does not aim to provide an exhaustive look at anything. Rather, the point is to provide a starting point, a window into the rapidly changing world of AI in 2024 and how we might start engaging with it. The barrier of understanding between the average person and an AI developer is vast. I sit over here with an understanding I want to provide, but in between are “What is a computer?”, “What is Machine Learning”, “What are statistics?”, “What is linear regression?”, “What is a file?”, “What is a GPU?”, “What is a Machine Learning Model?”, “What is Generative AI” and many other questions. Those concepts are important, and this text will get to some of them, but I am going to try to write some things that are true about “Generative Artificial Intelligence”, or Gen AI, that don’t require that. Generative AI is AI that produces text, images, or video.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c1a7b704-bf98-43ee-87af-ee201a14482f":{"id_":"c1a7b704-bf98-43ee-87af-ee201a14482f","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ea5befba-0280-452f-9b58-fadc79af2f79","metadata":{},"hash":"X31IojphE9YTm31efyNNYJmZLbGzaXkqnbGTmLiZn44="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fa5f77d7-3072-48c2-bb40-462a457d0fdf","metadata":{},"hash":"LSnBoE05CbcF9BeYnQf/7FTVPxEvpkMkKkJNmvVE90M="}},"hash":"cjCfZ+3DZjVz8btPf2ZxlztVqjgwNoFix7tFIdNobHs=","text":"Generative AI is AI that produces text, images, or video.

I can write them down and use them later. I might do that for particularly special numbers that I’d like to remember. For example, I might write down the number for pi:\r\n3.14159265359 \r\nLater I can use that number to do some math. Maybe I will calculate the area of a circle. AI is, put simply, a very special, very cool, very big, series of numbers. We talk about AI Models, but that is just jargon for a copy of those numbers, a computer file just like a document but bigger than a movie file, full of row after row of numbers. The point of this text is to facilitate understanding how that big file of numbers is created and why it can be used to create documents and images and eerily convincing chatbots to encourage consideration of how it will fit into the world and change the parameters of modern work. Computing and AI Models\r\nA proper introduction to computing involves a long theoretical discussion on the nature of problem solving. That is a fairly good place to start because the real thing that changed recently to allow for AI is a revolutionary computing algorithm, rather than a revolutionary computer, though that did get built soon afterwards. Computing, or computer science, is all about being given a problem and finding a solution. Every computer application is a series of small problems being solved on demand. You send an email, and a series of math problems are solved to produce an email on your colleague’s phone. You press play on a video and a series of math problems are performed to fetch the video file from a server somewhere (a server is just another word for computer as far as we’re concerned) and more math is performed to show you the movie on your phone. This leads us to the basic entities of computer science: We have input numbers, we have a series of math calculations, and we have output numbers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"fa5f77d7-3072-48c2-bb40-462a457d0fdf":{"id_":"fa5f77d7-3072-48c2-bb40-462a457d0fdf","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c1a7b704-bf98-43ee-87af-ee201a14482f","metadata":{},"hash":"cjCfZ+3DZjVz8btPf2ZxlztVqjgwNoFix7tFIdNobHs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1b9081ec-6c19-49e4-9f11-9a0b7dca0e8a","metadata":{},"hash":"7zLSubuJ6PQmoaAjo7GdXWzuYnC45NhL7YjAd9mJ4TY="}},"hash":"LSnBoE05CbcF9BeYnQf/7FTVPxEvpkMkKkJNmvVE90M=","text":"You probably already know everything in a computer is numbers on some level, 0s and 1s, and that therefore means being a series of numbers is no defense against the claims of copyright infringement, or bad actions we will discuss in later chapters. This muddies the waters quite a bit when considering copyright infringement, and that is why the way in which AI Models, those particular series of numbers, are created, and then the way in which they are used, is crucial. Anatomy of an LLM \r\nA Large Language Model is a computer program that is the product of a long series of calculations designed to find a set of numbers that optimally represent the structure of all human knowledge and language. When stated like that, it’s unsurprising that it has captured the imagination and caused a frenzy of activity. Even the measured success of ChatGPT in that direction has fundamentally changed the nature of content creation and the assumptions that can be made about the source of an image, text, audio, or video. This chapter seeks to describe the various components of an LLM more from a political perspective than a technical one, though fundamentally the object being described is the same. An LLM starts as a set of “training data”. This training data is things people have written, news articles, books, blog posts, coding forums, textbooks, literally any human produced text that contains words in an arrangement that you want to include in your Large Language Model. Then you take a computer, and you run a lot of math on the training data. The computer creates a very large file filled with numbers. Each time the computer takes some of the copyrighted text, uses that text segment as input for a lot of math problems, and then updates the numbers in the file. After a long time, and many many math problems, the computer has created a very large file full of numbers that represent the relationships between all the text ingested as best as possible. This file has a very specific and special use. You can take this file of numbers, this LLM, and like putting a DVD in a DVD player, you can put it in an LLM player, and spin it up. Then you can give it a prompt, a passage of text, and the LLM program will use the numbers in the LLM file to do a lot of math, and it will give you the most statistically likely next word. This is called “running inference”.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1b9081ec-6c19-49e4-9f11-9a0b7dca0e8a":{"id_":"1b9081ec-6c19-49e4-9f11-9a0b7dca0e8a","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fa5f77d7-3072-48c2-bb40-462a457d0fdf","metadata":{},"hash":"LSnBoE05CbcF9BeYnQf/7FTVPxEvpkMkKkJNmvVE90M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"60821aa9-13ca-466a-b9b8-5aa5ba046b17","metadata":{},"hash":"a9OO8ZbZUSTsmqUYAVPdMsd2bkR/71ULgunk9j6/bwM="}},"hash":"7zLSubuJ6PQmoaAjo7GdXWzuYnC45NhL7YjAd9mJ4TY=","text":"This is called “running inference”. “But ChatGPT gives me a lot more than one word,” you might say. That’s true, and the way that happens is the LLM program does the math again, with its own predicted next word added to your prompt, and it finds the next word, and the next, and the next, until you tell it to stop. You can actually run inference on an LLM infinitely, and it will just continue to give you the next word like Netflix on autoplay. Of course, like Netflix, commercially available LLMs like ChatGPT won’t give you infinite text. When we run an LLM like that on a computer and make it available on the internet, we call that a server, and the server costs money and it has limitations on how much math it can do every second. Everything else about Large Language Models is changing rapidly, and frankly, this simplistic description is a sufficient, if not superior, starting point for examining the impacts and strategies of AI on things like healthcare, politics, and education. LLMs in 2023, LLMs in 2024\r\n        LLMs in 2023 were very big. The model file, that magic series of numbers that can be used with the right math problems to generate text, that file was huge. It was too big and required too much math to run inference on these models using your average computer. For most of 2023, therefore, the way that everyone accessed AI was through special commercially available computing systems that had enough power to load these model files and run inference on them\r\n        Access to these commercial servers was provided through various online services, the most famous being chatGPT from OpenAI and Microsoft, and Bard from Google. This meant these companies basically controlled the available AI chatbots for all but the most invested AI enthusiasts, people willing to put up the thousands of dollars required to build a computer capable of running an LLM. Even for those enthusiasts, their options for running their own LLM were limited. For most of 2023 the GPT models from OpenAI and Microsoft were far superior to anything else available, and those model files, those sets of numbers, are secret. The most popular “open source” model, i.e. publicly available model file, was llama-2 from Meta, i.e. Facebook.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"60821aa9-13ca-466a-b9b8-5aa5ba046b17":{"id_":"60821aa9-13ca-466a-b9b8-5aa5ba046b17","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1b9081ec-6c19-49e4-9f11-9a0b7dca0e8a","metadata":{},"hash":"7zLSubuJ6PQmoaAjo7GdXWzuYnC45NhL7YjAd9mJ4TY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9bc461aa-8f01-4213-a882-8911d7e35cf7","metadata":{},"hash":"iHWshJnoYBNP/bvQ51StJiW6A+T2FPWKWYulp10ng2k="}},"hash":"a9OO8ZbZUSTsmqUYAVPdMsd2bkR/71ULgunk9j6/bwM=","text":"publicly available model file, was llama-2 from Meta, i.e. Facebook. By all standards, the llama-2 model is not as intelligent as the proprietary GPT models. Things changed at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. More open-source models were released, notably the Mistral and Mixtral models, and Hugging Face, a platform for sharing open-source models, took off. Computational strategies were popularized for making the model files smaller, particularly a method called “quantizing”. These quantized model files are small enough for your average laptop or desktop computer to load and use to run inference, even without a GPU, i.e. a graphics card. Another big difference between the LLMs available on the internet from Microsoft and Google in 2023, and these smaller LLMs that can be run on a personal computer, is that the LLMs available online are censored. They have guardrails and safety features built in to ensure that only appropriate content is discussed or produced by the chatbot. Each company has their own strategies for deciding what is appropriate, but generally they all erred on the side of caution, being willing to ban many topics: Legal advice, medical advice, explicit adult topics, strategies for violence, and offensive or impolitic humor. Many of the newer open source models do not have any guardrails, and those that do can be modified by the AI community to create versions of them with the guardrails removed. With the advent of Hugging Face, an open source marketplace for model files and ways to run them, the community has been engaged in a flurry of model merging, fine-tuning, retraining, and every type of permutation and combination that might gain attention or find a business use case. Strategies for Healthcare\r\nGenerative AI Strategies for Healthcare are limited and difficult to justify. Generally people want their health care providers to be properly familiarized with their medical history without the assistance of AI. The discussion of AI in health care therefore tends to have more of a defensive tone. Frequently the justification for the use of Large Language models in medical settings is that it is improving on the sorry state of healthcare in many areas of the world even if it is not providing perfect recommendations.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"9bc461aa-8f01-4213-a882-8911d7e35cf7":{"id_":"9bc461aa-8f01-4213-a882-8911d7e35cf7","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"60821aa9-13ca-466a-b9b8-5aa5ba046b17","metadata":{},"hash":"a9OO8ZbZUSTsmqUYAVPdMsd2bkR/71ULgunk9j6/bwM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e5348cff-dfca-41ca-b115-34a57dd08194","metadata":{},"hash":"yZZPG8XMFQ9aE1IO6Y+Sa4pS8CwqxS0nuClQN2nISoQ="}},"hash":"iHWshJnoYBNP/bvQ51StJiW6A+T2FPWKWYulp10ng2k=","text":"In order to promote the use of AI, healthcare companies and their adjacent compatriots are highlighting the insufficiencies of medical systems in the US to justify the use of AI to fill in the gaps. I have heard many examples in various product presentations. One appealed to the concept that doctors do not read the very long medical histories of some cancer patients, and therefore a summary of that history produced by an LLM would categorically be an improvement on the state of things, even if it did contain incorrect information or exclude crucial information. Another example highlighted that a doctor on average has only 15 minutes for each patient, and that meant having suggested treatments and patient questions generated by AI would help a doctor who might otherwise be too tired or overworked to do their job properly. AI can also triage patient messages, the volume of which is increasing every day as more health centers ask their patients to use a text based message portal to communicate instead of phone calls. A Large Language Model can take a doctor’s technical appointment followup note and use it to generate a patient friendly summary that the doctor can edit or approve. Some of these uses are more comforting than others. Most people would not mind their doctor using AI to write nicer follow-up emails, but they also would not enjoy finding out their messages were being triaged by AI. What everyone will definitely not enjoy is if AI is used to ask health care providers to treat even more patients in a shorter time, rather than simply allowing them the relief of actually being able to provide better care. The basic question can be characterized with the example of the 15 minute doctor: If they are given AI to increase their productivity, does the patient get 15 minutes of even more excellent care, or is the doctor told to handle one patient every ten minutes now that AI can handle so much of the paperwork? AI for Healthcare: Then and Now\r\nAI for healthcare until recently focused on very specialized models that could take an input like a brain scan and give an output like a percentage likelihood that scan had a brain bleed in it.

At those crucial moments of diagnosis, a health care provider has a lot of support for determining their course of action, and it is unlikely most AI diagnosis models increased provider outcomes or efficiency in some way to justify the cost of licensing such a system. Large Language Models, however, have the potential of reducing administrative costs, and that could lead to the actual savings needed to justify the expenditure. They are also far less expensive to deploy and maintain than any specialized diagnostic model, and the variety of LLM providers means it is safer for healthcare systems to become reliant to some degree upon them than specialized models created and maintained by a single company. That is why use cases for LLMs in healthcare focus on things like insurance processing, patient appointments, and variable other quantifiable expenses related to provider services. There are various legal issues to navigate with LLMs in healthcare, notably with HIPAA compliance, a fairly solvable problem, and with FDA classification and approval, a more difficult problem. For HIPAA compliance, the issue mainly lies with the LLM vendor’s guarantee to follow HIPAA guidelines when handling health information data. Some LLM providers already provide that HIPAA compliance guarantee, while others do not, a notable example of the latter being chatGPT. For FDA approval, the main issue lies with the non-deterministic output of an LLM. What does that mean? It means basically that Large Language Models are a little random and inconsistent in their results so no FDA trial can be done right now that would be able to accurately measure how an LLM would perform later on in a widespread clinical setting. This is another reason administrative tasks are favored in health care. I suspect the vast majority of health care tasks will be to turn moments of creativity into moments of verification. The AI will generate the reports and the human will be there to verify and take responsibility for the outcome. The New York Times Lawsuit \r\nAt the end of 2023, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in Federal Court for copyright infringement and demanded money and the destruction of all the GPT models.

The New York Times (\"NYT\") went to a nearby courthouse with this lawsuit describing why OpenAI and Microsoft have violated civil laws regarding copyright, the evidence that they did this, and the solution they are proposing to fix the harm caused by this violation of law. As people are fond of pointing out, anyone can file a civil lawsuit. You just go to the courthouse with a description of the grievance called a complaint. From here OpenAI and Microsoft have a few moves:\r\n1) They can file an Answer. This would be their own letter to the court, describing why the complaint is not legitimate. Typically the deadline to file an answer after receiving notice of a lawsuit in federal court is three weeks, but this can be extended with a Motion. 2) They can file a different kind of letter called a Motion. A motion is a letter to the court about a current case that is trying to change the parameters of the case. This would not address the substance of the complaint, i.e. the content, but might object to the procedure, like claiming the court does not have jurisdiction or authority to handle this complaint and propose moving the case to another court or dismissing it. Another motion they might file is a motion to sever the case into two cases, one between NYT and OpenAI and a separate one between NYT and Microsoft. They might also file a motion to extend the deadline for filing a response. You can file a motion for whatever you want, and the judge reads it and can have a hearing on the motion where both sides get to argue about it, and then the judge grants or denies the motion. Motions take up a lot of time in court cases. 3) OpenAI and Microsoft might prefer to say nothing at all, and the best avenue for that is for their lawyers to talk to the NYT lawyers and decide on a settlement, where they make a (usually) secret agreement and the NYT and OpenAI go to the court and ask the judge to let them do the settlement and dismiss the case. However, if you read the 70 page letter the NYT filed, their complaint, it might seem like they are very upset, and would not want to settle. They are, after all, claiming billions of dollars in damages and demanding the destruction of all the OpenAI GPT models.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"cfcfe45e-8f4e-4105-8642-3558d19098c4":{"id_":"cfcfe45e-8f4e-4105-8642-3558d19098c4","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"485e97b4-faed-48df-a894-e8486f2f814b","metadata":{},"hash":"E8FnJd/cndDKuF+tXxBqSHVhe3z335ZQCb7DPh8p8Fc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f6f71774-1539-4a66-a930-cdb39c2427a4","metadata":{},"hash":"+g8JTz/fQxnfRNZ1cyovtbit+Ztgvslfe6E7fAAat2k="}},"hash":"eOqRjzE5FsCaJWY8UZnc3A0B6YKTuzlHI+usn7m1so0=","text":"Two factors on that though:\r\n1) A big part of claiming copyright is demonstrating a history of vociferously defending copyrighted works from unlicensed use. 2) Federal court is generally go big or go home.

The losing side can then try to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, to argue it again. The New York Times describes ChatGPT\r\nThe first 22 pages of the NYT lawsuit describe the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft. How it started:\r\n\"Microsoft has invested at least $13 billion in OpenAI Global LLC in exchange for which Microsoft will receive 75% of that company’s profits until its investment is repaid, after which Microsoft will own a 49% stake in that company.\"[1]\r\nHow it's going:\r\n\"Just three years after its founding, OpenAI shed its exclusively nonprofit status. It created OpenAI LP in March 2019, a for-profit company dedicated to conducting the lion’s share of OpenAI’s operations [... ] The result: OpenAI today is a commercial enterprise valued as high as $90 billion, with revenues projected to be over $1 billion in 2024\"[2]\r\n\"These commercial offerings have been immensely valuable for OpenAI. Over 80% of Fortune 500 companies are using ChatGPT. According to recent reports, OpenAI is generating revenues of $80 million per month, and is on track to surpass over $1 billion within the next 12 months.\"[3]\r\nThree quotations are included from the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella:\r\n\"'But beneath what OpenAI is putting out as large models, remember, the heavy lifting was done by the [Microsoft] Azure team to build the computer infrastructure. Because these workloads are so different than anything that’s come before. So we needed to completely rethink even the datacenter up to the infrastructure that first gave us even a shot to build the models. And now we’re translating the models into products.'\"[4]\r\n\"'[W]e were very confident in our own ability. We have all the IP rights and all the capability.

We are in there. We are below them, above them, around them. We do the kernel optimizations, we build tools, we build the infrastructure. So that’s why I think a lot of the industrial analysts are saying, ‘Oh wow, it’s really a joint project between Microsoft and OpenAI. ’ The reality is we are, as I said, very self-sufficient in all of this.'\"[6]\r\nThere's also a succinct and impressive description of what it really takes to make ChatGPT:\r\n\"According to Microsoft, it operated as 'a single system with more than 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs and 400 gigabits per second of network connectivity for each GPU server. ' This system ranked in the top five most powerful publicly known supercomputing systems in the world.\"[7]\r\nIn the picture painted by the NYT, it's kind of like Microsoft got to invest their money twice, once into OpenAI, and then also in their own AI Research and Development. The Crux of the New York Times Lawsuit\r\n        The basic claim of the New York Times is that their articles, the entire body of work in the New York Times history, was crucial to the training process for the OpenAI GPT models, the LLMs that power chatGPT, and that Microsoft and OpenAI are using those models to compete with the New York Times and hurt their business. Both the unlicensed use of the New York Times articles and the business competition are important to the case in order to prove copyright infringement. The examples provided in the lawsuit are of three general types:\r\n1. Instances where chatGPT produced full text from New York Times articles with proper prompting\r\n2. Instances where chatGPT or Bing used GPT models to read the latest New York Times articles and provide content or summary, thereby diverting traffic from the New York Times Website\r\n3. Evidence that the New York Times training data was weighted with particular importance in the GPT training process and is the main reason for its success.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"6f088055-3928-41e7-a181-e8433ffa28a6":{"id_":"6f088055-3928-41e7-a181-e8433ffa28a6","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f6f71774-1539-4a66-a930-cdb39c2427a4","metadata":{},"hash":"+g8JTz/fQxnfRNZ1cyovtbit+Ztgvslfe6E7fAAat2k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7b9c6c29-c451-4978-8880-ff0e450029e7","metadata":{},"hash":"InPH2+l7dbY91SdUuvl4CxyclTO/k28DojxXfCqiN1w="}},"hash":"bW7atYjYvKMKzeonaKPuyQJSwThQNOQ2bwRIUeV5Qt8=","text":"OpenAI Responds to the New York Times\r\nOpenAI responded soon after the New York Times filed their lawsuit, but they did so in a blog post rather than in court. Their response starts with a succinct summary of their position:\r\n“Our position can be summed up in these four points, which we flesh out below:\r\nWe collaborate with news organizations and are creating new opportunities\r\nTraining is fair use, but we provide an opt-out because it’s the right thing to do\r\n‘Regurgitation’ is a rare bug that we are working to drive to zero\r\nThe New York Times is not telling the full story”[8]\r\nOpenAI appears to be leaning into the idea that their use of New York Times data is transformative use, an exception under copyright law. They would claim that all the mathematical analysis to create the Large Language Model and the process by which the output is generated are by their nature  transformative processes that provide a categorical copyright exception. They do not address the commercial competition in their blog post, and it is not a coincidence the New York Times highlighted that so much. It is possible they are drawing on a recent Supreme Court precedent. The recent Andy Warhol Supreme Court case might signify a changing interpretation of fair use that takes into account whether the transformative work is competing in the same market as the original one. Justice Sotomayor delivers the Court's opinion in that case, Andy Warhol Foundation For The Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith Et Al, and at one point states: \"In this case, however, Goldsmith's original photograph of Prince, and AWF's copying use of that photograph in an image licensed to a special edition magazine devoted to Prince, share substantially the same purpose, and the use is of a commercial nature\"[9]\r\nTo me, the implication presented is that fair use of copyrighted materials can be impacted by whether the result is competing in the same commercial marketplace. The New York Times lawsuit therefore highlights the way that GPT models and their outputs compete directly with directly accessing the New York Times as a customer without Bing, or chatGPT, as an intermediary. AI and Congressional Regulation\r\nEvents at the end of January 2024 related to AI generated fake images have led to increased demand for AI regulation, which means one particular bipartisan AI regulation bill from the U.S. Senate is getting more attention. The press release for the bill states:\r\n“U.S.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"7b9c6c29-c451-4978-8880-ff0e450029e7":{"id_":"7b9c6c29-c451-4978-8880-ff0e450029e7","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6f088055-3928-41e7-a181-e8433ffa28a6","metadata":{},"hash":"bW7atYjYvKMKzeonaKPuyQJSwThQNOQ2bwRIUeV5Qt8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9fff9b9d-2d67-4595-a3be-4630edb4ce80","metadata":{},"hash":"uGDxPuwWFl+7tdtAAwyW0XXIvx82VEasjExqNpOQ7+Q="}},"hash":"InPH2+l7dbY91SdUuvl4CxyclTO/k28DojxXfCqiN1w=","text":"Senate is getting more attention. The press release for the bill states:\r\n“U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) and John Kennedy (R-La. ) introduced bipartisan legislation to provide more transparency on content generated by artificial intelligence (AI). The new bill would help ensure people know when they are viewing AI-made content or interacting with an AI chatbot by requiring clear labels and disclosures.”[10]\r\nI have a few immediate questions:\r\n1) Would this even help with the issues at hand? 2) Would this violate the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States? 3) Which kind of math counts as regulated AI generated content? The press release goes on to say:\r\n“‘People deserve to know whether or not the videos, photos, and content they see and read online is real or not,’ said Senator Schatz.”[11]\r\nI am sympathetic to this idea, but I am not sure it would survive a US Supreme Court challenge. That is probably why the rest of the press release tries to conflate people being fooled and scammed: \r\n““AI is moving quickly, and so are the companies that are developing it. Our bill would set an AI-based standard to protect U.S. consumers by telling them whether what they’re reading, seeing or hearing is the product of AI, and that’s clarity that people desperately need,” said Senator Kennedy. [... ]\r\n“The Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act would:\r\n“Require that developers of generative AI systems include a clear and conspicuous disclosure identifying AI-generated content and AI chatbots;\r\n“Make developers and third-party licensees take reasonable steps to prevent systematic publication of content without disclosures; and\r\n“Establish a working group to create non-binding technical standards so that social media platforms can automatically identify AI-generated content.”[12]\r\nConsumer protection laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission like this proposed bill rely on the financial harm perpetrated by deceptive advertising. I think there's not much basis to necessarily connect AI generated content with deceptive advertising. AI generated content can easily provide good information to consumers regardless of whether it is labeled that way. Then there is the question of \"what is AI generated content? \"\r\nThe bill itself says \"GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM.—The term ‘‘generative artificial intelligence system’’ means any system that uses artificial intelligence (as defined in section 238(g) of the John S.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"9fff9b9d-2d67-4595-a3be-4630edb4ce80":{"id_":"9fff9b9d-2d67-4595-a3be-4630edb4ce80","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7b9c6c29-c451-4978-8880-ff0e450029e7","metadata":{},"hash":"InPH2+l7dbY91SdUuvl4CxyclTO/k28DojxXfCqiN1w="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a095146c-59fb-4f89-82f8-160ff004cb73","metadata":{},"hash":"XLcAEEO/Nnss8wP8PuYcrQIYqweLKoORPRDL2gZFsKc="}},"hash":"uGDxPuwWFl+7tdtAAwyW0XXIvx82VEasjExqNpOQ7+Q=","text":"McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019) to generate or substantially modify image, video, audio, multimedia, or text content.\"[13]\r\nI tracked down that section and here it is:\r\n\"(g) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEFINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘artificial intelligence’’ includes the following: \r\n(1) Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets.

That definition is extremely broad and more than a little vague. It seems that we can do better when it comes to AI regulation, and if legislators don’t handle the line between consumer protection and free speech, the judiciary will have to do it for them. A Special Note for Teachers\r\nThere are no tools out there that can reliably inform you if something was written using AI or not. The transformative power of AI means that very quickly the tools to generate essays assigned for homework will far outpace the ability of tools to detect them. I can easily imagine tools specifically designed to imitate a student’s particular writing style and introduce convincing errors and mistakes. I can see two strategies to deal with a world in which a student can generate an essay in two minutes. The first is to simply increase their workload. Instead of one essay, assign five essays. Assign an essay on a different topic every single night. This brings us to the second strategy, which is oral assessments. Have them give an oral presentation on their essay to other students. It is quite possible that with these strategies, students would learn much faster anyway. Ironically, the use for which LLMs are most effective is self-learning.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"a095146c-59fb-4f89-82f8-160ff004cb73":{"id_":"a095146c-59fb-4f89-82f8-160ff004cb73","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9fff9b9d-2d67-4595-a3be-4630edb4ce80","metadata":{},"hash":"uGDxPuwWFl+7tdtAAwyW0XXIvx82VEasjExqNpOQ7+Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1ea624c7-cb61-43f4-b355-82e379db78ef","metadata":{},"hash":"pTXvXiDDP6ZsTUX8OTLJylGy/hkuN1aX7UiV2OLgWZg="}},"hash":"XLcAEEO/Nnss8wP8PuYcrQIYqweLKoORPRDL2gZFsKc=","text":"Ironically, the use for which LLMs are most effective is self-learning. An LLM is unparalleled in helpfulness, tirelessness, and tolerance when it comes to teaching. It is worrisome that so many teachers are discouraging their use under the guise of maintaining academic honesty. This is like discouraging your students from learning how to drive because of environmental issues. I hear from many students that they are discouraged from using generative AI, and they admit to doing so with tinges of shame in their demeanor. Meanwhile, they will graduate to a world in which every professional will have been pushed to increase their productivity with LLMs. If AI is not embraced by traditional educational institutions, new institutions that do emphasize using AI will arise to replace them. This is because AI skills will become some of the most valuable skills in the workforce, and those who use AI effectively will succeed faster. What’s Coming in 2024 and beyond\r\nAll of these factors are combining together to slow the adoption of large centralized closed LLMs like GPT, and push the adoption of smaller open source LLMs, or fully licensed proprietary LLMs for particular use cases or companies. Many large companies are building their own internal LLM system to assist their staff in order to maintain data privacy while still gaining the benefits of an AI powered workforce. Fully licensed proprietary LLMs provide the legal security and the privacy that some companies need. Many companies do not want to send their data to OpenAI, and they also want to be sure they are legally covered against all copyright issues. Open source models provide the low cost, flexibility, and control that other companies need. They don’t, however, necessarily provide protection against copyright issues depending on how the model was trained and how the regulation and court cases shake out over time. Open source models continue to become more diverse and powerful. Some are large, and some are small enough to run on a personal computer, and fairly soon, a phone. 2024 also brings us a United States Presidential election, which is a period of heightened media activity and content production. I expect AI will play a central role in this election year as the various political stakeholders involved in the campaigns realize that AI has the power to energize the populace in a way that few other topics do these days.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1ea624c7-cb61-43f4-b355-82e379db78ef":{"id_":"1ea624c7-cb61-43f4-b355-82e379db78ef","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Guide to AI for Everyone.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"sjxu4z6HP6o8pPlO0TSsDwAgKtyqg+251IkjZ5wOAy8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a095146c-59fb-4f89-82f8-160ff004cb73","metadata":{},"hash":"XLcAEEO/Nnss8wP8PuYcrQIYqweLKoORPRDL2gZFsKc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b17b70d0-58c0-44b2-b01d-8652009adcec","metadata":{},"hash":"RosvXSAv+gVAsewriF/Skd6hpAPblY3m/hyy3pbVYBA="}},"hash":"pTXvXiDDP6ZsTUX8OTLJylGy/hkuN1aX7UiV2OLgWZg=","text":"There is also a strong potential for the proliferation of LLMs specifically tailored to political causes, like a “voteGPT” that is a chatbot that encourages the users to go vote. On a more manipulative level, one might find an LLM based chatbot that advocates persuasively for a particular candidate. I would also be remiss if I did not mention the ease with which misinformation can be spread by AI. Misinformation can be obvious, like a false news story, or it can be less detectable. For example, generative AI can be used to automate online comments on political forums or social networks that make it seem like a large and diverse group of people support a particular viewpoint from various perspectives. Many people form impressions of general sentiments based on the various anonymous opinions they see in their online content. AI, War, and Terrorism\r\n        The line between war and terrorism can be blurry and arbitrary. AI has the potential to make it blurrier. This is because AI is the automation of attention, and attention is the key to political violence. Generally until now in order to tailor destruction to the advantage of a particular belief system or viewpoint, human attention and emotion was required to sustain the shaping of violence. That is a fairly abstract introduction, so let’s zoom in on the LLM. Large Language Models transform their inputs into output. You can give it an instruction like “Generate code to attack a server on the internet, send me all the data, and destroy all the data on that server”. That server might belong to a hospital. Right now chatGPT and other online tools won’t generate that code for you, but with the rise in open source LLMs, and the general drive of technology, AI could do so in the future. The line between terrorism and war in fact crystallizes quite quickly. Who is given AI with destruction powers? If it is only the government, then AI will mostly be used for war. If it is open source, and everyone has access to powerful AI in the future that can create and execute malicious code, then we might have a proliferation of online terrorism as a small group’s whims can be amplified by AI systems that can automate political attention and violence.

Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any way that even an advanced AI could be proven to be conscious, sentient, human, feel pain, or whatever quality might elevate it to personhood. In fact, as AI more effectively emulates humanity, the more we will have to question what it is that makes us human. Perhaps it is simply the way we come into existence for no good reason, fail to achieve our goals, and die pointlessly. It might be possible that in creating AI in our own image, we disillusion ourselves of our own humanity, reifying instead the existence of machines. There are many in the AI community who are also interested in longevity, and aspire to immortality, digitization of their consciousness, further immersion in virtual realities, and generally a desire to become more like the machine. As a society, we will have to deal with the way that AI challenges how we define ourselves and others as human. It is possible that society will experience various upheavals as more and more advanced AI is created, embodied, and given agency to perform tasks.

The principle that training AI models is permitted as a fair use is supported by a wide range of\r\n, ,   , ,   , ,\r\n, and  that recently submitted comments to the US Copyright Office.

Memorization is a rare failure of the learning process that we are continually making progress on, but\r\nit’s more common when particular content appears more than once in training data, like if pieces of it\r\nappear on lots of different public websites. So we have measures in place to limit inadvertent\r\nmemorization and prevent regurgitation in model outputs. We also expect our users to act\r\nresponsibly; intentionally manipulating our models to regurgitate is not an appropriate use of our\r\ntechnology and is against our terms of use. Just as humans obtain a broad education to learn how to solve new problems, we want our AI models\r\nto observe the range of the world’s information, including from every language, culture, and industry.

Introduce Bipartisan Legislation\r\nTo Provide More Transparency On AI-Generated\r\nContent\r\nNew Bill Would Require Clear Labels On AI-Made Content\r\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i) and John Kennedy (R-La. ) introduced bipartisan legislation to\r\nprovide more transparency on content generated by artificial intelligence (AI). The new bill would help ensure people\r\nknow when they are viewing AI-made content or interacting with an AI chatbot by requiring clear labels and disclosures. “People deserve to know whether or not the videos, photos, and content they see and read online is real or not,” said\r\nSenator Schatz. “Our bill is simple – if any content is made by artificial intelligence, it should be labeled so that people\r\nare aware and aren’t fooled or scammed. ”\r\n“AI is moving quickly, and so are the companies that are developing it. Our bill would set an AI-based standard to protect\r\nU.S. consumers by telling them whether what they’re reading, seeing or hearing is the product of AI, and that’s clarity\r\nthat people desperately need,” said Senator Kennedy. In May, an artificial photo of an explosion near the Pentagon went viral, duping Americans and triggering a dip in the\r\nstock market. Deepfake images of President Trump being arrested were viewed by millions on social media,\r\ndemonstrating the types of manipulation that could be used during elections. And fraudsters are already abusing AI\r\nsystems to generate scam calls, impersonating a loved one’s voice and scamming Americans out of their hard-earned\r\nmoney. As generative AI becomes increasingly convincing and widespread, new measures must be adopted to ensure that\r\nAmericans can determine genuine from machine-generated content.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"4ffcfb20-0a28-4730-8667-a246e016b7dc":{"id_":"4ffcfb20-0a28-4730-8667-a246e016b7dc","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0jN8YMwP2rCCz1uuSUpeshPx1Tu2b9ukKYcZCnPwruU=","metadata":{},"hash":"KR4JZoOjNUEg3vZJKyGQE1+ZH6z0AtAZXZ70/IuDcis="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3ded341a-4716-4f95-8d79-7da53304117d","metadata":{},"hash":"Fu9Y1bbK9gawguh28XThZXAb2Zq4W4jXUt9s54cC24Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8b188b2c-c81e-4188-959a-fca74a60ae45","metadata":{},"hash":"ZyMkSzY35iObDYM1339kmMbA33Xy/uwztQB9ci3gasc="}},"hash":"BvnnZaAWmKC70m725nVSoPNrcFFCukCGzolybnEmDGA=","text":"The Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act would:\r\nRequire that developers of generative AI systems include a clear and conspicuous disclosure identifying AI-generated\r\ncontent and AI chatbots;\r\nMake developers and third-party licensees take reasonable steps to prevent systematic publication of content without\r\ndisclosures; and\r\nEstablish a working group to create non-binding technical standards so that social media platforms can automatically\r\nidentify AI-generated content.

As writers our members value the creativity and\r\ndiligence and critical thinking that only human beings can bring to drama, comedy, and news. At minimum, viewers,\r\nlisteners, and readers need to be fully informed when content is generated, in whole or in part, by artificial intelligence\r\ntechnology rather than by human creators,” said Lowell Peterson, Executive Director of Writers Guild of America, East. “Thank you Senators Schatz and Kennedy for introducing the AI Labeling Act.

Americans deserve to know when, where,\r\nhow, and why they are interacting with text, audio and audiovisual media not created by humans,” said Duncan Crabtree-\r\nIreland, SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator. “The rapid spread of AI-generated content poses new threats to our online information landscape, creating more\r\nvulnerabilities for the public to consume and interact with disinformation and manipulated content. Developers and\r\nsocial media platforms must take the first step to clearly disclose and identify AI-generated content to curb potential\r\nharms and protect users.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"8b188b2c-c81e-4188-959a-fca74a60ae45":{"id_":"8b188b2c-c81e-4188-959a-fca74a60ae45","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0jN8YMwP2rCCz1uuSUpeshPx1Tu2b9ukKYcZCnPwruU=","metadata":{},"hash":"KR4JZoOjNUEg3vZJKyGQE1+ZH6z0AtAZXZ70/IuDcis="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4ffcfb20-0a28-4730-8667-a246e016b7dc","metadata":{},"hash":"BvnnZaAWmKC70m725nVSoPNrcFFCukCGzolybnEmDGA="}},"hash":"ZyMkSzY35iObDYM1339kmMbA33Xy/uwztQB9ci3gasc=","text":"The AI Labeling Act establishes clear and simple guidelines for companies to be responsible\r\nstewards and foster a better informed public as we work to understand both the benefits and threats of generative AI,”\r\nsaid Nicole Gill, Executive Director of Accountable Tech.

NATURE OF THE ACTION \r\n1. Independent journalism is vital to our democracy. It is also increasingly rare and \r\nvaluable. For more than 170 years, The Times has given the world deeply reported, expert, \r\nindependent journalism. Times journalists go where the story is, often at great risk and cost, to \r\ninform the public about important and pressing issues. They bear witness to conflict and disasters, \r\nprovide accountability for the use of power, and illuminate truths that would otherwise go unseen. Their essential work is made possible through the efforts of a large and expensive organization \r\nthat provides legal, security, and operational support, as well as editors who ensure their journalism \r\nmeets the highest standards of accuracy and fairness. This work has always been important. But \r\nCase 1:23-cv-11195   Document 1   Filed 12/27/23   Page 1 of 69","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"09c61afd-2575-4dee-859d-bb96b2586a6f":{"id_":"09c61afd-2575-4dee-859d-bb96b2586a6f","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"Pk3Z94dwLved1NM2QJLnTAp27Ars908MkdlkLGIk/h0=","metadata":{},"hash":"axyZHs9tWSrYiiB5ygTP+4FyKh6Ux5y7JFv5BCKoQpM="}},"hash":"RSdzuF5FS3a1IYTlY5T9ZrgQivgqq8IIwidtZHRT+qc=","text":"2 \r\n  \r\nwithin a  damaged  information  ecosystem  that  is  awash in unreliable  content, The Times’s \r\njournalism provides a service that has grown even more valuable to the public by supplying \r\ntrustworthy information, news analysis, and commentary. 2. Defendants’ unlawful use of The Times’s work to create artificial intelligence \r\nproducts that compete with it threatens The Times’s ability to provide that service. Defendants’ \r\ngenerative artificial intelligence (“GenAI”) tools rely on large-language models (“LLMs”) that \r\nwere built by copying and using millions of The Times’s copyrighted news articles, in-depth \r\ninvestigations, opinion pieces, reviews, how-to guides, and more. While Defendants engaged in \r\nwidescale copying from many sources, they gave Times content particular emphasis when building \r\ntheir LLMs—revealing a preference that recognizes the value of those works. Through Microsoft’s \r\nBing Chat (recently rebranded as “Copilot”) and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Defendants seek to free-ride \r\non The Times’s massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive products \r\nwithout permission or payment. 3. The Constitution and the Copyright Act recognize the critical importance of giving \r\ncreators exclusive rights over their works. Since our nation’s founding, strong copyright protection \r\nhas empowered those who gather and report news to secure the fruits of their labor and investment. Copyright law protects The Times’s expressive, original journalism, including, but not limited to, \r\nits millions of articles that have registered copyrights. 4. Defendants have refused to recognize this protection. Powered by LLMs containing \r\ncopies of Times content, Defendants’ GenAI tools can generate output that recites Times content \r\nverbatim, closely summarizes it, and mimics its expressive style, as demonstrated by scores of \r\nexamples.

By  providing Times  content without The Times’s  permission  or \r\nauthorization, Defendants’ tools undermine and damage The Times’s relationship with its readers \r\nand deprive The Times of subscription, licensing, advertising, and affiliate revenue. 6. Using the valuable intellectual property of others in these ways without paying for \r\nit has been extremely lucrative for Defendants. Microsoft’s deployment of Times-trained LLMs \r\nthroughout its product line helped boost its market capitalization by a trillion dollars in the past \r\nyear alone. And OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT has driven its valuation to as high as $90 billion. Defendants’ GenAI business interests are deeply intertwined, with Microsoft recently highlighting \r\nthat its use of OpenAI’s “best-in-class frontier models” has generated customers—including \r\n“leading AI startups”—for Microsoft’s Azure AI product.1!

The New York Times and its Mission \r\n1. Almost Two Centuries of High-Quality, Original, Independent News \r\n26. The New York Times is a trusted source of quality, independent journalism whose \r\nmission is to seek the truth and help people understand the world. Begun as a small, local \r\nnewspaper, The Times has evolved to a diversified multi-media company with readers, listeners, \r\nand viewers around the globe. Today, more than 10 million subscribers pay for Times journalism, \r\nCase 1:23-cv-11195   Document 1   Filed 12/27/23   Page 8 of 69","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"4932eb2d-b1d8-4e57-8873-0d5934ef0b34":{"id_":"4932eb2d-b1d8-4e57-8873-0d5934ef0b34","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"LYrkiii7B2fuDRPbCC7Yf9AGqheJ/0UF99mhY7GpMh8=","metadata":{},"hash":"oRbgfGPc9MYIkvvqWa2QLyIVDEX4z29JrHFlCaOBKn4="}},"hash":"tWlvsDmlLaYHsxAvhL3xhueOwij6MJmPL/QdeKjjNyU=","text":"9 \r\n  \r\nwhich includes everything from news to opinion, culture to business, cooking to games, and \r\nshopping recommendations to sports. 27. Founded in 1851, The New York Times has a long history of providing the public \r\nwith independent journalism of the highest quality. When Adolph Ochs bought the newspaper out \r\nof bankruptcy in 1896, he vowed that The Times would be fiercely independent, dedicated to \r\njournalism of the highest integrity, and devoted to the public welfare. He articulated the vision:  \r\n“To give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of any party, sect, or interest \r\ninvolved. ” These words still animate The New York Times today, nearly two centuries later. 28. Producing original independent journalism is at the heart of this mission. Times \r\njournalists cover the most important stories across the globe; in a typical year, The Times sends \r\njournalists to report on the ground from more than 160 countries. Together, along with editors, \r\nphotographers, audio producers, videographers, graphic designers, data analysts, and more, The \r\nTimes’s newsroom produces groundbreaking journalism across every major storytelling format. 29. The quality of The Times’s coverage has been widely recognized with many \r\nindustry and peer accolades, including 135 Pulitzer Prizes since its first Pulitzer award in 1918 \r\n(nearly twice as many as any other organization). The Times’s journalism is also deeply impactful. Academics, teachers, and scientists have used it to educate and innovate. Lawmakers have cited it \r\nto introduce legislation. Judges have referenced it in rulings. And tens of millions of people rely \r\non it every day. 30. Times  journalists  are  experts in their  subject  matter and  among  the  most \r\nexperienced and talented in the industry. In many cases, their work is enhanced by professional \r\nexpertise: lawyers cover the court, doctors cover health care, and veterans cover the military. Many \r\nTimes journalists draw on decades of experience. One reporter covering the White House, for \r\nCase 1:23-cv-11195   Document 1   Filed 12/27/23   Page 9 of 69","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"bf771303-af1f-4fd0-9db6-d89dc056e0b8":{"id_":"bf771303-af1f-4fd0-9db6-d89dc056e0b8","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"woW1xDeufzyr6ngbDtdMGzqHwa64ZPjnhxG5eEAj3i0=","metadata":{},"hash":"KFOCgtGWKEwCKhyYlBgIcj60E/huyRG+zT9OdCvL6wA="}},"hash":"vzIIYHIJptROk6fFhcmqwXoBvNevHm0MaFxmitVosXs=","text":"10 \r\n  \r\nexample, has reported on five administrations. His colleague, a White House photographer, has \r\ncovered seven. 31. In addition to journalists who spend considerable time and effort reporting pieces, \r\nThe Times employs hundreds of editors to painstakingly review its journalism for accuracy, \r\nindependence, and fairness, with at least two editors reviewing each piece prior to publication and \r\nmany more reviewing the most important and sensitive pieces. The Times also has among the \r\nlargest and most robust Standards teams in the industry, which advises the newsroom daily on \r\nconsistency,  accuracy, fairness, and  clarity  in  its  reporting and  maintains  stringent  ethical \r\nguidelines for journalists and their work. The Times also maintains an internal Stylebook, a \r\ndocument that is updated over time to guide the tone of its journalism and the prose used. There is \r\nalso an ongoing dialogue among journalists and editors to ensure The Times fairly and thoroughly \r\ncovers the right stories and presents what it finds in a clear and compelling way. Producing Times \r\njournalism is a creative and deeply human endeavor. 2. Groundbreaking, In-Depth Journalism and Breaking News at Great Cost \r\n32. To produce world-class journalism, The Times invests an enormous amount of time, \r\nmoney, expertise, and talent, both in its newsroom and product, technology, and other supporting \r\nteams. Core areas of focus include:  \r\n33. Investigative Reporting. The Times does deep investigations—which usually take \r\nmonths and sometimes years to report and produce—into complex and important areas of public \r\ninterest. The Times’s reporters routinely uncover stories that would otherwise never come to light. They have exposed problems, held power to account, and demanded the public’s attention. In \r\ninvestigating these areas, Times coverage often results in meaningful reforms. These stories are \r\nCase 1:23-cv-11195   Document 1   Filed 12/27/23   Page 10 of 69","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"abea883f-5912-41c2-84fb-df8b8126b1d4":{"id_":"abea883f-5912-41c2-84fb-df8b8126b1d4","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"gAdeQSvg9IxHit+yWtWxDSrC2hvXNVRZ54Iv605lp88=","metadata":{},"hash":"pzTTM5hnM2A3xHpdc96k5VHi8/jNgwgXlpYXGdTclVI="}},"hash":"xSjf/+S8wEU2HgydFxWHb7Dl2cctbdOU/X/oPpUwPQQ=","text":"11 \r\n  \r\nwritten and edited in the style that is widely associated with The Times, one that readers trust and \r\nseek out. 34. Breaking News Reporting. The Times  is  equally  committed  to  quickly  and \r\naccurately reporting breaking news. In an era in which speculation, disinformation, and spin often \r\ndrown out the truth when news breaks, The Times fills an important need for trustworthy news \r\nwith journalists who have the subject-matter expertise, news judgment, and sources required to \r\nreport the facts in a compelling way. This year, The Times has provided detailed, real-time \r\ncoverage on breaking news across a range of topics, including the upcoming U.S. elections, \r\nmultiple mass shootings including those in Maine and Nashville, wars in Ukraine and the Middle \r\nEast, a spate of natural disasters around the globe, and the collapse of major regional banks. 35. Beat Reporting: The Times invests significantly in its beat reporting by giving its \r\nbeat reporters the time and space to go deep on a single topic. At The Times, these topics vary from \r\npublic health to religion to architecture, and from the Pentagon to Hollywood to Wall Street. They \r\nalso include The Times’s dozens of national and international bureaus, where correspondents are \r\nsteeped in the communities they cover. Because this type of journalism is grounded in the expertise \r\nand deep connections of Times journalists, beat coverage enriches The Times’s reporting. 36. Reviews and Analysis. The Times is a trusted source for reviews and analysis of \r\narts and culture, including food, books, art, film, theater, television, music, fashion, and travel. In \r\n2016, it acquired the product review site Wirecutter, which recommends the best products in \r\ndozens of categories including home goods, technology, health and fitness, and more. Each year, \r\nWirecutter spends tens of thousands of hours conducting rigorous testing and research to produce \r\na catalog of reviews that today covers thousands of products.

Commentary and Opinion. The Times publishes opinion articles that contribute \r\nto public debate across the world. Many of these articles come from The Times’s staff of world-\r\nrenowned columnists. Additionally, leaders in business, politics, religion, education, and the arts \r\nwrite guest essays for The Times’s opinion section, giving readers the opportunity to understand a \r\nwide range of experiences, perspectives, and ideas about the most important issues of the day. 3. A Commitment to Quality Journalism \r\n38. It takes enormous resources to publish, on average, more than 250 original articles \r\nevery day. Many of these articles take months—and sometimes longer—to report. That output is \r\nthe work of approximately 5,800 full-time equivalent Times employees (as of December 31, 2022), \r\nsome 2,600 of whom are directly involved in The Times’s journalism operations. 39. Quite often, the most vital news reporting for society is the most resource-intensive. Some of The Times’s most important journalism requires deploying teams of journalists at great \r\ncost to report on the ground around the world, providing best-in-class security and support, filing \r\nlawsuits against government entities to bring information to light, and supporting journalists \r\nthrough investigations that can take months or years. 40. Subscription,  advertising, licensing,  and  affiliate  revenue make  this  reporting \r\npossible. In 1996, The Times launched a core news website, alongside its paid print edition, that \r\nwas free. As readers shifted from print news to digital products, The Times—like most print \r\npublishers—faced the prospect of not being able to continue funding its journalism. In response, \r\nThe Times reinvented its business model to incorporate digital subscriptions. The Times launched \r\nits metered paywall in 2011, in what it called “a bet that readers will pay for news they are \r\naccustomed to getting free.”2II\r\nI\r\n2 Jeremy W.

In the 12 years since The Times launched its paywall, it has grown its paid digital \r\nsubscribership and developed a direct relationship with its online audience through its tireless \r\ncommitment to making journalism “worth paying for. ” Generating and maintaining direct traffic \r\nto its online content and mobile applications are critical components of The Times’s financial \r\nsuccess. 42. By the third quarter of 2023, The Times had nearly 10.1 million digital and print \r\nsubscribers worldwide. The Times aims to have 15 million subscribers by year-end 2027. 43. The Times makes journalism “worth paying for” by publishing articles that are \r\nexhaustively researched and reported, thoughtfully written, carefully edited, and thoroughly fact-\r\nchecked. 44. In addition, The Times has deepened its relationship with its readers by expanding \r\nits offerings to better encompass its readers’ specific interests, including best-in-class offerings \r\nlike Cooking, Wirecutter, Games, and The Athletic. 45. The Times’s paywall does not require payment for all access to The Times’s \r\ncontent. To build audience engagement and loyalty, The Times’s access model generally offers \r\nregistered users free access to a limited number of articles and other content before requiring them \r\nto subscribe for access to additional content. Approximately 50 to 100 million users, on average, \r\nengage with The Times’s digital content each week. This traffic is a key source of advertising \r\nrevenue and helps drive future subscriptions to The Times. 46. The Times also compiled digital archives of all its material going back to its \r\nfounding, at significant cost. Its digital archives include The New York Times Article Archive, with \r\nCase 1:23-cv-11195   Document 1   Filed 12/27/23   Page 13 of 69","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"65628014-229c-4741-b8f5-c5cfca8757eb":{"id_":"65628014-229c-4741-b8f5-c5cfca8757eb","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"pQc3ZwU9MMeZPcXliQSb3pc96syhJ9YXSiXgKF8jckw=","metadata":{},"hash":"cwApRj3WdHRmqQIKInzsrYUrbY+NC1+Ycpqmz8wBBCQ="}},"hash":"MZB6JkXW3VZbCRRR1348iX8YUQIq9MRPHTfaYeqc/2k=","text":"14 \r\n  \r\npartial and full-text digital versions of articles from 1851 to today, and the TimesMachine, a \r\nbrowser-based digital replica of all issues from 1851 to 2002.

Making great journalism is harder than ever. Over the past two decades, the \r\ntraditional business models that supported quality journalism have collapsed, forcing the shuttering \r\nof newspapers all over the country. It has become more difficult for the public to sort fact from \r\nfiction in today’s information ecosystem, as misinformation floods the internet, television, and \r\nother  media. If The Times  and  other  news  organizations  cannot  produce  and  protect  their \r\nindependent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill. 48. The protection of The Times’s intellectual property is critical to its continued ability \r\nto fund world-class journalism in the public interest. If The Times and its peers cannot control the \r\nuse of their content, their ability to monetize that content will be harmed. With less revenue, news \r\norganizations will have fewer journalists able to dedicate time and resources to important, in-depth \r\nstories, which creates a risk that those stories will go untold. Less journalism will be produced, \r\nand the cost to society will be enormous. 49. The Times depends on its exclusive rights of reproduction, adaptation, publication, \r\nperformance, and display under copyright law to resist these forces. The Times has registered the \r\ncopyright  in  its  print  edition  every  day  for  over  100  years,  maintains  a  paywall,  and  has \r\nimplemented terms of service that set limits on the copying and use of its content.

The Times requires third parties to obtain permission before using Times content \r\nand trademarks for commercial purposes, and for decades The Times has licensed its content under \r\nnegotiated licensing agreements. These agreements help ensure that The Times controls how, \r\nwhere, and for how long its content and brand appears and that it receives fair compensation for \r\nthird-party use. Third parties, including large tech platforms, pay The Times significant royalties \r\nunder these agreements in exchange for the right to use Times content for narrowly defined \r\npurposes. The agreements prohibit uses beyond those authorized purposes. 51. Times content is also available for licenses for certain uses through the Copyright \r\nClearance Center (“CCC”), a clearinghouse that licenses material to both corporate and academic \r\nusers. Through the CCC, The Times permits limited licenses for instruction, academic, other \r\nnonprofit uses, and limited commercial uses. For example, a for-profit business can acquire a CCC \r\nlicense to make a photocopy of Times content for internal or external distribution in exchange for \r\na licensing fee of about ten dollars per article. A CCC license to post a single Times article on a \r\ncommercial website for up to a year costs several thousand dollars. 52. The Times’s ability to continue to attract and grow its digital subscriber base and to \r\ngenerate digital advertising revenue depends on the size of The Times’s audience and users’ \r\nsustained engagement directly with The Times’s websites and mobile applications.

The Times reached out to Microsoft and OpenAI in April 2023 to raise intellectual \r\nproperty concerns and explore the possibility of an amicable resolution, with commercial terms \r\nand technological guardrails that would allow a mutually beneficial value exchange between \r\nDefendants and The Times. These efforts have not produced a resolution. B. Defendants’ GenAI Products \r\n1. A Business Model Based on Mass Copyright Infringement \r\n55. OpenAI was formed in December 2015 as a “non-profit artificial intelligence \r\nresearch company. ” OpenAI started with $1 billion in seed money from its founders, a group of \r\nsome of the wealthiest technology entrepreneurs and investors and companies like Amazon Web \r\nServices and InfoSys. This group included Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and X Corp. (formerly \r\nknown as Twitter); Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn; Sam Altman, the former president \r\nof Y Combinator; and Greg Brockman, the former Chief Technology Officer of Stripe. 56. Despite accepting very large investments from enormously wealthy companies and \r\nindividuals at its founding, OpenAI originally maintained that its research and work would be \r\nentirely unmotivated by profit. In a December 11, 2015, press release, Brockman and co-founder \r\nIlya Sutskever (now OpenAI’s President and Chief Scientist, respectively) wrote: “Our goal is to \r\nadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, \r\nCase 1:23-cv-11195   Document 1   Filed 12/27/23   Page 16 of 69","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"6b242c47-ec34-4bc7-bff2-76e6cc886cdc":{"id_":"6b242c47-ec34-4bc7-bff2-76e6cc886cdc","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"XVUL/d9dkk2VtAXXfs+kwJ8DNl7mSnzFcicSk8DAONg=","metadata":{},"hash":"7MsLZS7ooWOQspKT2K50fLc17VWUHnxabno4TWx/qZY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1d026393-918b-40b6-b74e-92c9e851edce","metadata":{},"hash":"M6yiOb/5muiq3Y4xQ/IC5LClVJvV5kFXEXCDeJHu8YE="}},"hash":"KUQMiQnBEkYBKlAQdoWrlwi57y+CLu8wxDX6ULOihrg=","text":"17 \r\n  \r\nunconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial \r\nobligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact. ” In accordance with that mission, \r\nOpenAI promised that its work and intellectual property would be open and available to the public, \r\nthat its “[r]esearchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work, whether as papers, blog \r\nposts, or code” and that its “patents (if any) will be shared with the world. ” \r\n57. Despite its early promises of altruism, OpenAI quickly became a multi-billion-\r\ndollar for-profit business built in large part on the unlicensed exploitation of copyrighted works \r\nbelonging to The Times and others. Just three years after its founding, OpenAI shed its exclusively \r\nnonprofit  status. It  created  OpenAI  LP  in  March  2019,  a  for-profit  company dedicated to \r\nconducting the lion’s share of OpenAI’s operations—including product development—and to \r\nraising capital from investors seeking a return. OpenAI’s corporate structure grew into an intricate \r\nweb of for-profit holding, operating, and shell companies that manage OpenAI’s day-to-day \r\noperations and grant OpenAI’s investors (most prominently, Microsoft) authority and influence \r\nover OpenAI’s operations, all while raising billions in capital from investors. The result: OpenAI \r\ntoday is a commercial enterprise valued as high as $90 billion, with revenues projected to be over \r\n$1 billion in 2024. 58. With the transition to for-profit status came another change: OpenAI also ended its \r\ncommitment to openness. OpenAI released the first two iterations of its flagship GenAI model, \r\nGPT-1 and GPT-2, on an open-source basis in 2018 and 2019, respectively. But OpenAI changed \r\ncourse in 2020, starting with the release of GPT-3 shortly after OpenAI LP and other for-profit \r\nOpenAI entities were formed and took control of product design and development. 59. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are both orders of magnitude more powerful than the two \r\nprevious generations, yet Defendants have kept their design and training entirely a secret.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1d026393-918b-40b6-b74e-92c9e851edce":{"id_":"1d026393-918b-40b6-b74e-92c9e851edce","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"XVUL/d9dkk2VtAXXfs+kwJ8DNl7mSnzFcicSk8DAONg=","metadata":{},"hash":"7MsLZS7ooWOQspKT2K50fLc17VWUHnxabno4TWx/qZY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6b242c47-ec34-4bc7-bff2-76e6cc886cdc","metadata":{},"hash":"KUQMiQnBEkYBKlAQdoWrlwi57y+CLu8wxDX6ULOihrg="}},"hash":"M6yiOb/5muiq3Y4xQ/IC5LClVJvV5kFXEXCDeJHu8YE=","text":"For \r\nCase 1:23-cv-11195   Document 1   Filed 12/27/23   Page 17 of 69","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"4c4d16ea-8141-4b11-8def-68bc553758f3":{"id_":"4c4d16ea-8141-4b11-8def-68bc553758f3","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"KK0sVkA+J+os/E7zlJBdttqH41zteNURCug4/b+YapI=","metadata":{},"hash":"51csQ0FWbWN0T7iiKU8m+Q/MYEMBzq7pNx+5LwnFlFI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"67820a29-fb32-421a-9dd2-93387c2439c5","metadata":{},"hash":"/QZ+Qosl9O63FlYZJPtFwFfhhYZsuB/SA6hxqM9VWWY="}},"hash":"/6hXs8PnXrpd6sX2dFeNzqdtSLW1FmN260nT0/mh7sg=","text":"18 \r\n  \r\nprevious generations, OpenAI had voluminous reports detailing the contents of the training set, \r\ndesign, and hardware of the LLMs. Not so for GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.

Since at least 2019, Microsoft has been, and continues to be, intimately involved in \r\nthe training, development, and commercialization of OpenAI’s GPT products. In an interview with \r\nthe Wall Street Journal at the 2023 World Economic Forum, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said \r\nthat the “ChatGPT and GPT family of models ... is something that we’ve been partnered with \r\nOpenAI deeply now for multiple years. ” Through this partnership, Microsoft has been involved in \r\nthe creation and commercialization of GPT LLMs and products based on them in at least two ways. 67. First, Microsoft created and operated bespoke computing systems to execute the \r\nmass  copyright  infringement  detailed  herein. These  systems  were  used  to  create multiple \r\nreproductions of The Times’s intellectual property for the purpose of creating the GPT models that \r\nexploit and, in many cases, retain large portions of the copyrightable expression contained in those \r\nworks. 68. Microsoft is the sole cloud computing provider for OpenAI. Microsoft and OpenAI \r\ncollaborated to design the supercomputing systems powered by Microsoft’s cloud computer \r\nplatform Azure, which were used to train all OpenAI’s GPT models after GPT-1. In a July 2023 \r\nkeynote speech at the Microsoft Inspire conference, Mr. Nadella said: “We built the infrastructure \r\nto train their models. They’re innovating on the algorithms and the training of these frontier \r\nmodels. ”  \r\n69. That infrastructure was not just general purpose computer systems for OpenAI to \r\nuse as it saw fit. Microsoft specifically designed it for the purpose of using essentially the whole \r\ninternet—curated to disproportionately feature Times Works—to train the most capable LLM in \r\nhistory. In a February 2023 interview, Mr. Nadella said:  \r\nBut beneath what OpenAI is putting out as large models, remember, \r\nthe heavy lifting was done by the [Microsoft] Azure team to build \r\nthe computer infrastructure.

How GenAI Models Work \r\n75. At the heart of Defendants’ GenAI products is a computer program called a “large \r\nlanguage model,” or “LLM. ” The different versions of GPT are examples of LLMs. An LLM \r\nworks by predicting words that are likely to follow a given string of text based on the potentially \r\nbillions of examples used to train it. 76. Appending the output of an LLM to its input and feeding it back into the model \r\nproduces sentences and paragraphs word by word. This is how ChatGPT and Bing Chat generate \r\nresponses to user queries, or “prompts. ”  \r\n77. LLMs encode the information from the training corpus that they use to make these \r\npredictions as numbers called “parameters. ” There are approximately 1.76 trillion parameters in \r\nthe GPT-4 LLM. 78. The process of setting the values for an LLM’s parameters is called “training. ” It \r\ninvolves storing encoded copies of the training works in computer memory, repeatedly passing \r\nthem through the model with words masked out, and adjusting the parameters to minimize the \r\ndifference between the masked-out words and the words that the model predicts to fill them in. 79. After being trained on a general corpus, models may be further subject to “fine-\r\ntuning” by, for example, performing additional rounds of training using specific types of works to \r\nbetter mimic their content or style, or providing them with human feedback to reinforce desired or \r\nsuppress undesired behaviors. 80. Models  trained  in  this  way are  known  to  exhibit  a behavior called \r\n“memorization.”10IRFÉ6IP UISPHZ7I6FZIHPSF6IKHYJK6UI6FZLIGPGGIHZKZÉ6IGÉHSZIKYH6PY7 IYBIJÉ6ZHPÉG I6FZLI\r\nI\r\n10 GERRIT J.J.

This phenomenon shows that LLM parameters encode retrievable copies of many \r\nof those training works. 81.

For example, an LLM may be asked to generate \r\na text output based on specific external data, such as a document, provided as context. Using this \r\nmethod, Defendants’ synthetic search applications: (1) receive an input, such as a question; (2) \r\nretrieve relevant documents related to the input prior to generating a response; (3) combine the \r\noriginal input with the retrieved documents in order to provide context; and (4) provide the \r\ncombined data to an LLM, which generates a natural-language response.11II4 I FYG7IQZGYGUI ZÉH5FI\r\nHZ RG6 ISZ7ZHÉ6Z0IP7I6FP IGÉLIJÉLIZY6Z7 PHZGLI5YKLIYHI5GY ZGLIKÉHÉKFHÉ ZIGYHI I6FÉ6I6FZIJY0ZG I\r\n6FZJ ZGHZ IJÉLI7Y6IFÉHZIJZJYHPZZ08I\r\nC.

Unauthorized Retrieval and Dissemination of Current News \r\n108. Synthetic search applications built on the GPT LLMs, including Bing Chat and \r\nBrowse with Bing for ChatGPT, display extensive excerpts or paraphrases of the contents of search \r\nresults, including Times content, that may not have been included in the model’s training set. The \r\n“grounding” technique employed by these products includes receiving a prompt from a user, \r\ncopying Times content relating to the prompt from the internet, providing the prompt together with \r\nthe copied Times content as additional context for the LLM, and having the LLM stitch together \r\nparaphrases or quotes from the copied Times content to create natural-language substitutes that \r\nserve the same informative purpose as the original. In some cases, Defendants’ models simply spit \r\nout several paragraphs of The Times’s articles. 109. The contents of such synthetic responses often go far beyond the snippets typically \r\nshown with ordinary search results. Even when synthetic search responses include links to source \r\nmaterials, users have less need to navigate to those sources because their expressive content is \r\nalready quoted or paraphrased in the narrative result. Indeed, such indication of attribution may \r\nmake users more likely to trust the summary alone and not click through to verify.

The 10 gunmen from Gaza knew exactly how to find the Israeli \r\nintelligence hub — and how to get inside. After crossing into Israel, they headed east on five motorcycles, two \r\ngunmen on each vehicle, shooting at passing civilian cars as they \r\npressed forward. Ten miles later, they veered off the road into a stretch of woodland, \r\ndismounting outside an unmanned gate to a military base. They blew \r\nopen the barrier with a small explosive charge, entered the base and \r\npaused to take a group selfie. Then they shot dead an unarmed Israeli \r\nsoldier dressed in a T-shirt. For a moment, the attackers appeared uncertain about where to go \r\nnext. Then one of them pulled something from his pocket: a color-\r\ncoded map of the complex. Reoriented, they found an unlocked door to a fortified building. Once inside, they entered a room filled with computers — the \r\nmilitary intelligence hub. Under a bed in the room, they found two \r\nsoldiers taking shelter. The gunmen shot both dead.

For years, the Hamptons were a hot summer destination for young, \r\nup-and-coming New Yorkers and the old and new moneyed alike. It \r\nwas a place to see and be seen. Stories of Mick Jagger partying in \r\nMontauk spread like lore, and Andy Warhol once hosted the Rolling \r\nStones at his beachfront compound. It wasn’t uncommon for young \r\ncollege graduates in the city to save up and pool together to rent a \r\nsummer house and get a taste of the glamour. In a 1999 interview with New York Magazine, Jay-Z put it simply: \r\n“I mean, the Hamptons is cool. ” \r\nThe Hamptons still have a mythological reputation, fueled by the \r\ncelebrity cachet that comes with square footage, seclusion and ocean \r\nwaves. “Kaia Gerber, Ina Garten and Diplo walk into a bar — that \r\nis to say, the Hamptons holds a certain, je ne sais quoi? Where else \r\nwould these mega names be in the same sentence? ” said Jacob \r\nRutledge, a 22-year-old model and content creator. But the Hamptons are not what they once were. A slew of factors — \r\nextremely expensive housing costs (high even for the Hamptons), \r\nstrict rules around how many people can share a home, a crackdown \r\non nightlife and the pandemic fueling more people with children to \r\nlive there year round — combined to make the summer resort less \r\ndesirable among everyday 20- and 30-somethings. Despite  his  instinct  to  marvel  at  the  Long  Island  refuge,  Mr. Rutledge, who lives in Ridgewood, Queens, isn’t going out to the \r\nHamptons this summer.

Willful Infringement  \r\n124. Defendants’ unauthorized reproduction and display of Times Works is willful. Defendants were intimately involved in training, fine-tuning, and otherwise testing the GPT \r\nmodels. Defendants knew or should have known that these actions involved unauthorized copying \r\nof Times Works on a massive scale during training, resulted in the unauthorized encoding of huge \r\nnumbers of such works in the models themselves, and would inevitably result in the unauthorized \r\ndisplay of such works that the models had either memorized or would present to users in the form \r\nof synthetic search results.

Misappropriation of Commercial Referrals \r\n127. In addition to their reproduction of Times news media, both Bing Chat and Browse \r\nwith Bing for ChatGPT also display extensive excerpts or paraphrases of Wirecutter content when \r\nprompted. As shown below, the contents of these synthetic responses go beyond ordinary search \r\nresults, often fully reproducing Wirecutter’s recommendations for particular items and their \r\nunderlying rationale. 128. Wirecutter  generates the  vast  majority  of  its  revenue  via affiliate  referral. Wirecutter’s journalists, acting with full editorial independence and integrity, spend tens of \r\nthousands of hours each year researching and testing products to ensure that they recommend only \r\nthe best. Those recommendations, when presented to Wirecutter’s readers, include direct links to \r\nmerchants, who in turn often give Wirecutter a portion of the sale price upon completion of a \r\ntransaction. That is, when a user purchases a Wirecutter-recommended product through the link in \r\na Wirecutter article, Wirecutter generally earns a commission on the sale. Wirecutter does not \r\nreceive affiliate referral revenue if a user purchases the Wirecutter-recommended product through \r\na link on Defendants’ platforms. As with The Times’s other products, decreases in traffic to \r\nWirecutter also impact its advertising and subscription revenue.

Defendants have no permission to copy, \r\nreproduce, and display Times content for free. 155. A well-established market exists for The Times to provide paid access to and use of \r\nits works both by individual and institutional users. Unauthorized copying of Times Works without \r\npayment to train LLMs is a substitutive use that is not justified by any transformative purpose. 156. As discussed above, The Times strictly limits the content it makes accessible for \r\nfree and prohibits the use of its material (whether free or paid for) for commercial uses absent a \r\nspecific authorization. Not only has it implemented a paywall, but it requires a license for entities \r\nthat  wish  to  use  its  content  for  commercial  purposes. These  licenses,  which  place  strict \r\nrequirements on what content is being licensed and for what purposes it may be used, generate \r\nmillions of dollars in revenue for The Times per year. Here, by contrast, Defendants have used \r\nalmost a century’s worth of copyrighted content, for which they have not paid The Times fair \r\ncompensation. This lost market value of The Times’s copyrighted content represents a significant \r\nharm to The Times caused by Defendants. 157. If individuals can access The Times’s highly valuable content through Defendants’ \r\nown products without having to pay for it and without having to navigate through The Times’s \r\npaywall, many will likely do so.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \r\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT \r\nNo. 21–869. Argued October 12, 2022—Decided May 18, 2023 \r\nIn 2016, petitioner Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. (AWF) licensed to Condé Nast for $10,000 an image of “Orange \r\nPrince”—an orange silkscreen portrait of the musician Prince created \r\nby pop artist Andy Warhol—to appear on the cover of a magazine com-\r\nmemorating Prince. Orange Prince is one of 16 works now known as \r\nthe Prince Series that Warhol derived from a copyrighted photograph \r\ntaken in 1981 by respondent Lynn Goldsmith, a professional photog-\r\nrapher. Goldsmith had been commissioned by Newsweek in 1981 to\r\nphotograph a then “up and coming” musician named Prince Rogers\r\nNelson, after which Newsweek published one of Goldsmith’s photos \r\nalong with an article about Prince. Years later, Goldsmith granted a \r\nlimited license to Vanity Fair for use of one of her Prince photos as an \r\n“artist reference for an illustration. ”  The terms of the license included \r\nthat the use would be for “one time” only. Vanity Fair hired Warhol to \r\ncreate the illustration, and Warhol used Goldsmith’s photo to create a\r\npurple silkscreen portrait of Prince, which appeared with an article \r\nabout Prince in Vanity Fair’s November 1984 issue. The magazine\r\ncredited Goldsmith for the “source photograph” and paid her $400.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"fc028d13-7ca3-4f58-9fa9-be04946944d5":{"id_":"fc028d13-7ca3-4f58-9fa9-be04946944d5","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"Mg/GSIv7bW+Pq6o1Il3xf1pBjaRbGHp416OYe4KVlJY=","metadata":{},"hash":"hg/h8NuaLroR3U2dw0BR4ZaZbZE5svWzmYVO44yFdmg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"96940e9c-2467-460f-a33b-fa5995f08eef","metadata":{},"hash":"TSeZfYFOoNxqZNLjJzCb4vl3uY2WYLleJMvywNyCtog="}},"hash":"lQnH3KpVfaohwrZdP0VVGXxR7CQNpXkwH/Igg9+8ycU=","text":"The magazine\r\ncredited Goldsmith for the “source photograph” and paid her $400.

C. §107\r\nand granted AWF summary judgment on its defense of fair use. The \r\nCourt of Appeals reversed, finding that all four fair use factors favored \r\nGoldsmith. In this Court, the sole question presented is whether the \r\nfirst fair use factor, “the purpose and character of the use, including \r\nwhether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educa-\r\ntional purposes,” §107(1), weighs in favor of AWF’s recent commercial\r\nlicensing to Condé Nast. Held: The “purpose and character” of AWF’s use of Goldsmith’s photo-\r\ngraph in commercially licensing Orange Prince to Condé Nast does not \r\nfavor AWF’s fair use defense to copyright infringement. Pp. 12–38. (a) AWF contends that the Prince Series works are “transformative,”\r\nand that the first fair use factor thus weighs in AWF’s favor, because \r\nthe works convey a different meaning or message than the photograph. But the first fair use factor instead focuses on whether an allegedly\r\ninfringing use has a further purpose or different character, which is a\r\nmatter of degree, and the degree of difference must be weighed against\r\nother considerations, like commercialism. Although new expression, \r\nmeaning, or message may be relevant to whether a copying use has a\r\nsufficiently distinct purpose or character, it is not, without more, dis-\r\npositive of the first factor. Here, the specific use of Goldsmith’s photo-\r\ngraph alleged to infringe her copyright is AWF’s licensing of Orange\r\nPrince to Condé Nast. As portraits of Prince used to depict Prince in\r\nmagazine stories about Prince, the original photograph and AWF’s \r\ncopying use of it share substantially the same purpose. Moreover, \r\nAWF’s use is of a commercial nature. Even though Orange Prince adds \r\nnew expression to Goldsmith’s photograph, in the context of the chal-\r\nlenged use, the first fair use factor still favors Goldsmith.

The central question it asks is \r\nwhether the use “merely supersedes the objects of the original creation \r\n. . . (supplanting the original), or instead adds something new, with a\r\nfurther purpose or different character. ” Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, \r\nInc., 510 U. S. 569, 579 (internal quotation marks and citations omit-\r\nted). As most copying has some further purpose and many secondary \r\nworks add something new, the first factor asks “whether and to what \r\nextent” the use at issue has a purpose or character different from the \r\noriginal. Ibid. (emphasis added). The larger the difference, the more\r\nlikely the first factor weighs in favor of fair use. A use that has a fur-\r\nther purpose or different character is said to be “transformative,” but \r\nthat too is a matter of degree. Ibid. To preserve the copyright owner’s \r\nright to prepare derivative works, defined in §101 of the Copyright Act \r\nto include “any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed,\r\nor adapted,” the degree of transformation required to make “trans-\r\nformative” use of an original work must go beyond that required to \r\nqualify as a derivative. The Court’s decision in Campbell is instructive. In holding that par-\r\nody may be fair use, the Court explained that “parody has an obvious \r\nclaim to transformative value” because “it can provide social benefit, \r\nby shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a \r\nnew one. ”  510 U.

In a broad sense, a use that has \r\na distinct purpose is justified because it furthers the goal of copyright,\r\nnamely, to promote the progress of science and the arts, without di-\r\nminishing the incentive to create. In a narrower sense, a use may be \r\njustified because copying is reasonably necessary to achieve the user’s \r\nnew purpose. Parody, for example, “needs to mimic an original to \r\nmake its point. ”  Id., at 580–581. Similarly, other commentary or crit-\r\nicism that targets an original work may have compelling reason to \r\n“conjure up” the original by borrowing from it. Id., at 588. An inde-\r\npendent justification like this is particularly relevant to assessing fair\r\nuse where an original work and copying use share the same or highly \r\nsimilar purposes, or where wide dissemination of a secondary work \r\nwould otherwise run the risk of substitution for the original or licensed\r\nderivatives of it. See, e.g., Google, 593 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26). In sum, if an original work and secondary use share the same or\r\nhighly similar purposes, and the secondary use is commercial, the first \r\nfair use factor is likely to weigh against fair use, absent some other \r\njustification for copying. Pp. 13–20. (2) The fair use provision, and the first factor in particular, re-\r\nquires an analysis of the specific “use” of a copyrighted work that is \r\nalleged to be “an infringement. ”  §107. The same copying may be fair\r\nwhen used for one purpose but not another. See Campbell, 510 U. S., \r\nat 585. Here, Goldsmith’s copyrighted photograph has been used in \r\nmultiple ways. The Court limits its analysis to the specific use alleged\r\nto be infringing in this case—AWF’s commercial licensing of Orange \r\nPrince to Condé Nast—and expresses no opinion as to the creation, \r\ndisplay, or sale of the original Prince Series works.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"99c71173-49ca-4b72-ac02-c17f01bf16cf":{"id_":"99c71173-49ca-4b72-ac02-c17f01bf16cf","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ticfIAiB52kpVjkuKK3+3f/D3hXS38z7ZXfpzjO/Tdw=","metadata":{},"hash":"e8KMlSpv39prCBMyQb+vewu9gtWLIJ3hpeHVA+k998E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1c7cfcad-7184-429e-8c42-e733a4dd7dcd","metadata":{},"hash":"wnw2IEDMfsbAdpWJMBvIqEJ2AmadFW6jBb7IOSXLVBs="}},"hash":"4hzdG5VEmX74RS0wQOMkLnnM2ZX1xw4PpwPFYdnYmQA=","text":"In the context of \r\nCondé Nast’s special edition magazine commemorating Prince, the \r\npurpose of the Orange Prince image is substantially the same as that\r\nof Goldsmith’s original photograph.

Otherwise, “transformative use” would swallow \r\nthe copyright owner’s exclusive right to prepare derivative works, as\r\nmany derivative works that “recast, transfor[m] or adap[t]” the origi-\r\nnal, §101, add new expression of some kind. The meaning of a second-\r\nary work, as reasonably can be perceived, should be considered to the \r\nextent necessary to determine whether the purpose of the use is dis-\r\ntinct from the original. For example, the Court in Campbell considered \r\nthe messages of 2 Live Crew’s song to determine whether the song had\r\na parodic purpose. But fair use is an objective inquiry into what a user \r\ndoes with an original work, not an inquiry into the subjective intent of \r\nthe user, or into the meaning or impression that an art critic or judge \r\ndraws from a work. Even granting the District Court’s conclusion that Orange Prince \r\nreasonably can be perceived to portray Prince as iconic, whereas Gold-\r\nsmith’s portrayal is photorealistic, that difference must be evaluated\r\nin the context of the specific use at issue. The purpose of AWF’s recent \r\ncommercial licensing of Orange Prince was to illustrate a magazine \r\nabout Prince with a portrait of Prince. Although the purpose could be\r\nmore specifically described as illustrating a magazine about Prince \r\nwith a portrait of Prince, one that portrays Prince somewhat differ-\r\nently from Goldsmith’s photograph (yet has no critical bearing on her \r\nphotograph), that degree of difference is not enough for the first factor \r\nto favor AWF, given the specific context and commercial nature of the \r\nuse. To hold otherwise might authorize a range of commercial copying \r\nof photographs to be used for purposes that are substantially the same\r\nas those of the originals. AWF asserts another related purpose of Orange Prince, which is to\r\ncomment on the “dehumanizing nature” and “effects” of celebrity. No \r\ndoubt, many of Warhol’s works, and particularly his uses of repeated \r\nimages, can be perceived as depicting celebrities as commodities.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e0c13c3f-3e83-4f3f-8cba-f2820d7df04d":{"id_":"e0c13c3f-3e83-4f3f-8cba-f2820d7df04d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f4roAaOlUj/M8oatJzcgfJqsSM6ckxlxa8d++YcDO0c=","metadata":{},"hash":"MhRtSUAdhei35duXzmdGRCyJY4PitHua17qYMWyKyLw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ab48c37a-be0f-4735-bc64-4781e78c9976","metadata":{},"hash":"JQMfw2UlQObHdO93ZpcS+0HSnfCE03yQHmg1sVF66wc="}},"hash":"NZW/8kQFbTM+sFrNQuZIbbOi6lxsLvYHmBSN0u4B10U=","text":"But \r\neven if such commentary is perceptible on the cover of Condé Nast’s \r\ntribute to “Prince Rogers Nelson, 1958–2016,” on the occasion of the \r\nman’s death, the asserted commentary is at Campbell’s lowest ebb: It \r\n“has no critical bearing on” Goldsmith’s photograph, thus the commen-\r\ntary’s “claim to fairness in borrowing from” her work “diminishes ac-\r\ncordingly (if it does not vanish). ” Campbell, 510 U.

Although the Court of Appeals analyzed each fair use fac-\r\ntor, the only question before this Court is whether the court\r\nbelow correctly held that the first factor, “the purpose and\r\ncharacter of the use, including whether such use is of a com-\r\nmercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes,”\r\n§107(1), weighs in Goldsmith’s favor. AWF contends that \r\nthe Prince Series works are “transformative,” and that the \r\nfirst factor therefore weighs in its favor, because the works \r\nconvey a different meaning or message than the photo-\r\ngraph.

But the first fair use factor instead focuses on whether an \r\nallegedly infringing use has a further purpose or different \r\ncharacter, which is a matter of degree, and the degree of \r\ndifference must be weighed against other considerations, \r\nlike commercialism.

Campbell, 510 U. S., at 579 (emphasis \r\nadded). The larger the difference, the more likely the first \r\nfactor weighs in favor of fair use. The smaller the differ-\r\nence, the less likely.

That is important because the word “transform,” though not\r\nincluded in §107, appears elsewhere in the Copyright Act. The statute defines derivative works, which the copyright \r\nowner has “the exclusive righ[t]” to prepare, §106(2), to in-\r\nclude “any other form in which a work may be recast, trans-\r\nformed, or adapted,” §101. In other words, the owner has a \r\nright to derivative transformations of her work. Such \r\ntransformations may be substantial, like the adaptation of\r\na book into a movie. To be sure, this right is “[s]ubject to” \r\nfair use. §106; see also §107. The two are not mutually \r\nexclusive.

Distinguishing between parody (which targets an author \r\nor work for humor or ridicule) and satire (which ridicules\r\nsociety but does not necessarily target an author or work),\r\nthe Court further explained that “[p]arody needs to mimic \r\nan original to make its point, and so has some claim to use \r\nthe creation of its victim’s (or collective victims’) imagina-\r\ntion, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so \r\nrequires justification for the very act of borrowing. ” Id., at \r\n580–581.

Although the purpose could be more specifically described\r\nas illustrating a magazine about Prince with a portrait of\r\nPrince, one that portrays Prince somewhat differently from\r\nGoldsmith’s photograph (yet has no critical bearing on her\r\nphotograph), that degree of difference is not enough for the\r\nfirst factor to favor AWF, given the specific context of the \r\nuse.

Therefore, the \r\n“purpose and character of the use, including whether such\r\nuse is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational \r\npurposes,” §107(1), weighs in Goldsmith’s favor.

The Foundation now owns \r\nMr. Warhol’s image of Prince and it recently sought to li-\r\ncense that image to a magazine looking for a depiction of\r\nPrince to accompany an article about Prince. Ibid. Ms. Goldsmith seeks to license her copyrighted photograph to\r\nexactly these kinds of buyers. And because the purpose and \r\ncharacter of the Foundation’s challenged use and the pur-\r\npose and character of her own protected use overlap so com-\r\npletely, Ms. Goldsmith argues that the first statutory factor \r\ndoes not support a fair-use affirmative defense. As I see it, the second view of the law is the better one. Nothing in the copyright statute calls on judges to speculate \r\nabout the purpose an artist may have in mind when work-\r\ning on a particular project. Nothing in the law requires\r\njudges to try their hand at art criticism and assess the aes-\r\nthetic character of the resulting work. Instead, the first \r\nstatutory fair-use factor instructs courts to focus on “the \r\npurpose and character of the use, including whether such \r\nuse is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational \r\npurposes. ”  §107(1) (emphases added). By its terms, the law \r\ntrains our attention on the particular use under challenge. And it asks us to assess whether the purpose and character \r\nof that use is different from (and thus complements) or is\r\nthe same as (and thus substitutes for) a copyrighted work. It’s a comparatively modest inquiry focused on how and for \r\nwhat reason a person is using a copyrighted work in the\r\nworld, not on the moods of any artist or the aesthetic quality\r\nof any creation. To my mind, three contextual clues confirm that this\r\nreading of the statutory text is the correct one. First, the statutory preamble to all four fair-use factors\r\ninstructs courts to assess whether the person asserting a\r\nfair-use defense seeks to “use” a copyrighted work “for pur-\r\nposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"2e25e991-4381-46be-a03e-fe3aea37dc7e":{"id_":"2e25e991-4381-46be-a03e-fe3aea37dc7e","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"4W9HV5kOg7puaasRHVkOqIK6AD4/1lGufPyliTRHSDo=","metadata":{},"hash":"ZyrBU64y/6lRu7CM5eu8Nij7qQyD27Otd6AIfsPdVcM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d32aa318-7868-4cd9-89f9-ae5a24c0ca43","metadata":{},"hash":"0byrwTLbn1lqb4edTa0TcaZ404Pn9DmJWJ27GRUrmnE="}},"hash":"Lwh2TDiLNZeKtKRd1EBxWQ6urEKyBaWGby08uxcXPew=","text":"3 Cite as:  598 U.

Once more, the statute indicates that a court must examine \r\nthe purpose of the particular use under challenge, not the\r\nartistic purpose underlying a work. And once more, the \r\nstatute tasks courts with asking whether the challenged\r\nuse serves a different purpose (as, say, a “criticism” of or\r\n“comment” on the original) or whether it seeks to serve the\r\nsame purpose (as a substitute for the original). Second, the copyright statute expressly protects a copy-\r\nright holder’s exclusive right to create “derivative works”\r\nthat “transfor[m]” or “adap[t]” his original work. §§101,\r\n106(2). So saying that a later user of a copyrighted work \r\n“transformed” its message and endowed it with a “new aes-\r\nthetic” cannot automatically mean he has made fair use of \r\nit. Contra, post, at 1–2, 22–23, 34–36 (KAGAN, J., dissent-\r\ning). To hold otherwise would risk making a nonsense of \r\nthe statutory scheme—suggesting that transformative uses \r\nof originals belong to the copyright holder (under §106) but \r\nthat others may simultaneously claim those transformative\r\nuses for themselves (under §107). We aren’t normally in\r\nthe business of putting a statute “at war with itself ” in this \r\nway. United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106, \r\n180 (1911). Finally, the fourth fair-use factor requires courts to as-\r\nsess “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or\r\nvalue of the copyrighted work. ”  §107(4). This Court has \r\ndescribed the fourth factor as the “most important” one. Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 \r\nU. S. 539, 566 (1985).

There is no double counting here. Contra, post, at \r\n22 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Instead, the statute proceeds \r\nfrom step to step, asking judges to assess whether the chal-\r\nlenged use (as revealed by its purpose, character, amount \r\nof source material used, and effect) serves as a complement\r\nto or a substitute for a copyrighted work. With all this in mind, the Court’s decision seems to me \r\nexactly right. Does Mr. Warhol’s image seek to depict \r\nPrince as a “larger-than-life” icon while Ms. Goldsmith’s \r\nphotograph attempts to cast him in a more “vulnerable” \r\nlight? See ante, at 28–35; post, at 9–10, 35 (KAGAN, J., dis-\r\nsenting). Or are the artistic purposes latent in the two im-\r\nages and their aesthetic character actually more similar \r\nthan that? Happily, the law does not require judges to tan-\r\ngle with questions so far beyond our competence. Instead, \r\nthe first fair-use factor requires courts to assess only \r\nwhether the purpose and character of the challenged use is \r\nthe same as a protected use. And here, the undisputed facts\r\nreveal that the Foundation sought to use its image as a com-\r\nmercial substitute for Ms. Goldsmith’s photograph.

Cf. post, at 10, 18 (KAGAN, J., \r\ndissenting). But under the first fair-use factor the salient \r\npoint is that the purpose and character of the Foundation’s\r\nuse involved competition with Ms. Goldsmith’s image.

Because the artist had such a commercial purpose, all the\r\ncreativity in the world could not save him. That doctrinal shift ill serves copyright’s core purpose. The law does not grant artists (and authors and composers\r\nand so on) exclusive rights—that is, monopolies—for their \r\nown sake. It does so to foster creativity—“[t]o promote the \r\n[p]rogress” of both arts and science. U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, \r\ncl. 8. And for that same reason, the law also protects the\r\nfair use of copyrighted material.

Stewart v. Abend, \r\n495 U. S. 207, 236 (1990) (internal quotation marks omit-\r\nted); see Campbell, 510 U. S., at 578–579.

And that factor is distinctive: It is the only one that fo-\r\ncuses on what the copier’s use of the original work accom-\r\nplishes. The first factor asks about the “character” of that \r\nuse—its “main or essential nature[,] esp[ecially] as strongly\r\nmarked and serving to distinguish. ”  Webster’s Third New \r\nInternational Dictionary 376 (1976).

In that \r\nway, the first factor gives the copier a chance to make his \r\ncase. See P. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L.Rev. 1105, 1116 (1990) (describing factor 1 as “the soul \r\nof ” the “fair use defense”). Look, the copier can say, at how \r\nI altered the original, and what I achieved in so doing. Look \r\nat how (as Judge Leval’s seminal article put the point) the \r\noriginal was “used as raw material” and was “transformed \r\n—————— \r\nowner”). The majority asserts that it is “aware of no authority for the \r\nproposition” that the fourth factor can thus protect against unlicensed \r\nfilm adaptations, insisting that the first factor must do (or at least share\r\nin) the work.

That is hardly the end of the fair-use\r\ninquiry (commercialism, too, may bear on the first factor,\r\nand anyway there are three factors to go), but it matters\r\nprofoundly.

We then expounded on when such a transformation \r\nhappens. Harking back to Justice Story, we explained that \r\na “new work” might “merely ‘supersede[ ] the objects’ of the\r\noriginal creation”—meaning, that it does no more, and for \r\nno other end, than the first work had. Ibid. (quoting Folsom \r\nv. Marsh, 9 F. Cas. 342, 348 (No. 4,901) (CC Mass. 1841)).

And as for the District \r\nCourt’s view that Warhol transformed Prince from a “vul-\r\nnerable, uncomfortable person to an iconic, larger-than-life\r\nfigure,” the majority is downright dismissive. Ante, at 32. Vulnerable, iconic—who cares? The silkscreen and the \r\nphoto, the majority claims, still have the same “essential\r\nnature. ” Ante, at 25, n. 14 (emphasis deleted). The description is disheartening. It’s as though Warhol\r\nis an Instagram filter, and a simple one at that (e.g., sepia-\r\ntinting). “What is all the fuss about?,” the majority wants \r\nto know. Ignoring reams of expert evidence—explaining, as\r\nevery art historian could explain, exactly what the fuss is \r\nabout—the majority plants itself firmly in the “I could paint\r\nthat” school of art criticism. No wonder the majority sees \r\nthe two images as essentially fungible products in the mag-\r\nazine market—publish this one, publish that one, what \r\ndoes it matter?

Warhol \r\nbased his silkscreen on a photo, but fundamentally changed\r\nits character and meaning. In belittling those creative con-\r\ntributions, the majority guarantees that it will reach the \r\nwrong result. Worse still, the majority maintains that those contribu-\r\ntions, even if significant, just would not matter. All of War-\r\nhol’s artistry and social commentary is negated by one\r\nthing: Warhol licensed his portrait to a magazine, and Gold-\r\nsmith sometimes licensed her photos to magazines too. That is the sum and substance of the majority opinion. Over and over, the majority incants that “[b]oth [works] are\r\nportraits of Prince used in magazines to illustrate stories \r\nabout Prince”; they therefore both “share substantially the\r\nsame purpose”—meaning, a commercial one.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"83c970c7-87c7-4250-aa0e-379ce71a9e40":{"id_":"83c970c7-87c7-4250-aa0e-379ce71a9e40","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0dQ48nu+AL6MIwdMoTLB1RsxiKjbxNvw+H5ia+uegf8=","metadata":{},"hash":"3Oj67s8ZC4ZV2lirAuUEgGNT3hdhG45rhE65mR7SzpE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ab049a43-afeb-406d-a257-2bc14e04ef55","metadata":{},"hash":"qO+9reX3KDV6FQEYsP1RYhixrwu3faP3+uHjyiF9vKc="}},"hash":"EZyk3nT1EFcdXsBguHFuSlHwAhT0407aS/zVHIMcEOw=","text":"Ante, at 22– \r\n23, 38; see ante, at 12–13, 27, n. 15, 33, 35.

As we have explained, an emphasis on commercial-\r\nism would “swallow” those uses—that is, would mostly de-\r\nprive them of fair-use protection. Campbell, 510 U. S., at \r\n584.

Recall that the majority\r\nconducts a kind of market analysis: Warhol, the majority \r\nsays, licensed his portrait of Prince to a magazine that\r\nGoldsmith could have licensed her photo to—and so may \r\nhave caused her economic harm.

In declining to acknowledge the im-\r\nportance of transformative copying, the Court today, and \r\nfor the first time, turns its back on how creativity works. III \r\nAnd the workings of creativity bring us back to Andy\r\nWarhol. For Warhol, as this Court noted in Google, is the \r\nvery embodiment of transformative copying. He is proof of \r\nconcept—that an artist working from a model can create \r\nimportant new expression. Or said more strongly, that ap-\r\npropriations can help bring great art into being. Warhol is \r\na towering figure in modern art not despite but because of \r\nhis use of source materials. His work—whether Soup Cans\r\nand Brillo Boxes or Marilyn and Prince—turned something \r\nnot his into something all his own. Except that it also be-\r\ncame all of ours, because his work today occupies a signifi-\r\ncant place not only in our museums but in our wider artistic \r\nculture. And if the majority somehow cannot see it—well,\r\nthat’s what evidentiary records are for. The one in this case \r\ncontained undisputed testimony, and lots of it, that War-\r\nhol’s Prince series conveyed a fundamentally different idea, \r\nin a fundamentally different artistic style, than the photo \r\nhe started from. That is not the end of the fair-use inquiry. The test, recall, has four parts, with one focusing squarely \r\non Goldsmith’s interests. But factor 1 is supposed to meas-\r\nure what Warhol has done. Did his “new work” “add[]\r\nsomething new, with a further purpose or different charac-\r\nter”? Campbell, 510 U. S., at 579.

Still more troubling are the consequences of today’s rul-\r\ning for other artists. If Warhol does not get credit for trans-\r\nformative copying, who will? And when artists less famous \r\nthan Warhol cannot benefit from fair use, it will matter \r\neven more. Goldsmith would probably have granted War-\r\nhol a license with few conditions, and for a price well within\r\nhis budget. But as our precedents show, licensors some-\r\ntimes place stringent limits on follow-on uses, especially to\r\nprevent kinds of expression they disapprove.

In their response, OpenAI summarized their position in four key points:\n\nThey collaborate with news organizations and create new opportunities. They consider their training process to be fair use, but they provide an opt-out option as a gesture of goodwill. They acknowledge the existence of a rare bug called \"regurgitation\" in their models and are working to minimize it. They claim that The New York Times is not telling the full story. OpenAI appears to emphasize their collaboration with news organizations, the transformative nature of their training process, their efforts to address issues like regurgitation, and their belief that The New York Times' lawsuit does not present the complete picture. They seem to assert that their use of data, including that of The New York Times, falls within fair use and that they are working to improve their models and address any concerns raised by the lawsuit. what might happen with this lawsuit? The outcome of the lawsuit filed by The New York Times against Microsoft and OpenAI could take several potential paths, depending on how the parties involved choose to proceed. Here are some possible scenarios:\n\nSettlement: The parties may choose to settle the lawsuit out of court. This could involve negotiations between the legal teams of The New York Times, Microsoft, and OpenAI to reach a mutually agreeable resolution. Settlements often involve financial compensation, agreements on future conduct, or other terms that resolve the dispute without going to trial. Motion Practice: Microsoft and OpenAI may file motions in response to the lawsuit. These motions could seek to dismiss the case, challenge the legal basis of the claims, or request other procedural actions from the court.

Trial: If the case proceeds to trial, both parties would present their arguments and evidence in court.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"a105df0b-a63a-4e93-9b77-d410072d1906":{"id_":"a105df0b-a63a-4e93-9b77-d410072d1906","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/analysis_1.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"MlngEm2gJ1xjSP5v+iIPBSoYioXlSUHbBgMfTvC8OHU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a8eecbf2-462c-4d51-b412-9b5f2171b804","metadata":{},"hash":"K2Vcu3QH9BcybDIFaQwYn7LR7T8EByEQA+DoQ635rPE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"198308a8-455d-4fe0-8e70-307f21804bd2","metadata":{},"hash":"M1A29Cn0NXsRONVUul7mdPlJCnqwhKXV18uD1rB22Ew="}},"hash":"RnTYGBGxn/CYQgkWdvn3vez8UCKGpSDIrxYOpqjgP7c=","text":"Trial: If the case proceeds to trial, both parties would present their arguments and evidence in court.

The parties involved may choose to pursue different legal strategies, leading to various possible outcomes in the case. how is the warhol case related to copyright? The Warhol case discussed earlier, specifically Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, is related to copyright law. Copyright law grants creators the exclusive rights to their original works, including the right to reproduce, distribute, and display their creations. In the context of the Warhol case, the issue at hand was whether Warhol's use of a photograph by Lynn Goldsmith in his artwork constituted fair use under copyright law. Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. The fair use doctrine aims to balance the rights of copyright holders with the public interest in promoting creativity, innovation, and free expression. In the Warhol case, the court examined whether Warhol's transformation of Goldsmith's photograph into a silkscreen artwork qualified as fair use. The court considered factors such as the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect of the use on the potential market for the original work. By analyzing these fair use factors, the court in the Warhol case addressed the intersection of artistic expression, transformative works, and copyright protection. The case highlighted the importance of balancing the rights of creators with the need to foster creativity, innovation, and the public interest in accessing and building upon existing works.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"198308a8-455d-4fe0-8e70-307f21804bd2":{"id_":"198308a8-455d-4fe0-8e70-307f21804bd2","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/analysis_1.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"MlngEm2gJ1xjSP5v+iIPBSoYioXlSUHbBgMfTvC8OHU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a105df0b-a63a-4e93-9b77-d410072d1906","metadata":{},"hash":"RnTYGBGxn/CYQgkWdvn3vez8UCKGpSDIrxYOpqjgP7c="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c110eb4c-05b0-4bd8-a74c-989421ee3a50","metadata":{},"hash":"8ZqxuJcqLa7ZSoyr6AQHAJbdZBCcODbmbkdJwE8exiA="}},"hash":"M1A29Cn0NXsRONVUul7mdPlJCnqwhKXV18uD1rB22Ew=","text":"Ultimately, the Warhol case provides valuable insights into how copyright law applies to transformative works and the boundaries of fair use in the context of artistic expression. what does sotomayor say in her opinion about commercial competition and fair use\n\n\nIn the context of fair use and commercial competition, Justice Sotomayor's opinion in the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith case may address the significance of commercial factors in the fair use analysis. Sotomayor's opinion could discuss how the commercial nature of a use, such as whether it is for-profit or non-profit, can impact the fair use determination. Sotomayor may emphasize that while the commercial nature of a use is a relevant factor in the fair use analysis, it is not dispositive. Instead, the court should consider the transformative nature of the use, the purpose and character of the use, and the overall impact on the original work's market value. Sotomayor's opinion may highlight that fair use is intended to strike a balance between protecting the rights of copyright holders and promoting creativity and innovation in society. Additionally, Sotomayor's opinion may discuss how commercial competition and market effects play a role in determining fair use. If a use directly competes with the original work in the market or diminishes the market value of the original work, it may weigh against a finding of fair use. Sotomayor's analysis may delve into how courts should consider these factors in the fair use analysis and how they impact the overall determination of whether a particular use qualifies as fair under copyright law. how might that have shaped the new york times lawsuit against openai and microsoft\n\n\nJustice Sotomayor's opinion in the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith case, particularly her emphasis on the commercial nature of a use and its impact on fair use, could potentially influence the New York Times lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft. Here's how it might have shaped the lawsuit:\n\nConsideration of Commercial Competition: The New York Times lawsuit may take into account the commercial competition aspect highlighted in Sotomayor's opinion. If the outputs generated by OpenAI's models, which allegedly include unauthorized use of The New York Times' trademarks, compete directly with The New York Times' original content in the market, this could be a significant factor in assessing the fair use defense put forth by OpenAI and Microsoft.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c110eb4c-05b0-4bd8-a74c-989421ee3a50":{"id_":"c110eb4c-05b0-4bd8-a74c-989421ee3a50","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/analysis_1.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"MlngEm2gJ1xjSP5v+iIPBSoYioXlSUHbBgMfTvC8OHU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"198308a8-455d-4fe0-8e70-307f21804bd2","metadata":{},"hash":"M1A29Cn0NXsRONVUul7mdPlJCnqwhKXV18uD1rB22Ew="}},"hash":"8ZqxuJcqLa7ZSoyr6AQHAJbdZBCcODbmbkdJwE8exiA=","text":"Market Effects: Sotomayor's opinion may have prompted The New York Times to focus on the market effects of OpenAI and Microsoft's actions on their original content. If the use of The New York Times' trademarks in AI-generated content diminishes the market value of The New York Times' journalism or affects its ability to attract readers or subscribers, this could strengthen The New York Times' argument against the fair use defense. Transformative Nature: Sotomayor's discussion of transformative use in the fair use analysis could also influence how The New York Times frames its arguments in the lawsuit. The extent to which OpenAI's use of The New York Times' data is transformative, and whether it adds new meaning or value beyond the original content, may be a key point of contention in the case. Overall, Sotomayor's opinion in the Andy Warhol case may have provided a legal framework and considerations that The New York Times could leverage in its lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, particularly in assessing the fair use defense and the impact of commercial competition on the use of copyrighted material in AI-generated content.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"6c3d0dfd-976a-41b5-9566-a62e0311c7d6":{"id_":"6c3d0dfd-976a-41b5-9566-a62e0311c7d6","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/my-app.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"AHx7SkXSYZKkJ0hkCPeya5GdxxG6rVATv2JiWwdho0U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7ddd3b64-8ceb-4162-b3df-fe95125d0acb","metadata":{},"hash":"3ZOGCmT7Tab83rjVXVq5f6vFsIyrYRS/6OXYck+IsZU="}},"hash":"YV21GoGSnqyGdiXXp7t+GTwt5AMvX392+HW/MZZzMT0=","text":"Chat Persistence Implementation\nFebruary 16, 2024\nThis conversation may reflect the link creator’s personalized data, which isn’t shared and can meaningfully change how the model responds.

a high-level overview of the modifications and additions you'll need to make:\n\nDatabase Integration:\n\nSet up a database to store user accounts and their associated conversation data. This can be a SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase) database, depending on your preference and the complexity of the data you plan to store. User Authentication:\n\nImplement user authentication in your app. This can be done using JWT tokens, OAuth, or any secure authentication mechanism. This will allow you to identify users and store/retrieve their conversation data from the database based on their unique identifiers. Modifying the Chat Engine to Store Conversations:\n\nModify the chat engine (./api/chat/engine/index.ts) to include functionality for saving and retrieving conversation data for each user. This might involve adjusting the chat engine's API to accept user identifiers and using these identifiers to store or fetch conversation histories from your database. Session Management:\n\nImplement session management on the client side (in your React components) and the server side. On the client side, you'll need to manage user sessions and include user identifiers in requests to the chat engine. On the server side, you'll need to parse these identifiers and use them to fetch or store data in the database. Client-Side Changes:\n\nModify the chat input component (./components/ui/chat/chat-input.tsx) to include user session information in the requests it sends. This ensures that the chat engine can associate messages with the correct user account. Adjust the chat messages component (./components/ui/chat/chat-messages.tsx) to fetch the conversation history for the logged-in user when the component mounts. This way, users can see their previous messages when they log back in. Backend API for User Data:\n\nCreate a new API route in your Next.js app for handling user data.

This integration involves processing chat messages to generate and store these embeddings, which can then be used to retrieve relevant context for future conversations. Custom API Route (./api/chat/route.ts): This route handles POST requests from the chat interface. It receives user messages, processes them through the chat engine (which includes generating vector embeddings and retrieving conversation context), and sends back the chatbot's response. The use of streaming responses allows for real-time communication between the client and server. LlamaIndex Stream (./api/chat/llamaindex-stream.ts): This module converts the asynchronous stream of responses from the LlamaIndex chat engine into a format that can be easily consumed by the frontend. It ensures that messages and potentially other types of data (like images) are streamed back to the client in real-time. How It Works Together:\nUser Interaction: Users interact with the ChatInput component to send messages. These messages are captured and sent to the backend via the custom API route. Backend Processing: The backend receives the messages, processes them with the custom chat engine (which might include consulting the vector embeddings for context), and generates responses based on the input and the conversation history. Streaming Responses: The chat engine's responses are streamed back to the client in real-time, using the LlamaIndex Stream mechanism to ensure that messages are displayed as soon as they are generated. Displaying Messages: The ChatMessages component listens for new messages from the backend and updates the chat interface accordingly, showing the conversation history between the user and the chatbot. This architecture enables a dynamic and responsive chat experience, leveraging advanced NLP models for generating chatbot responses and vector storage for managing conversation context. The use of modern web technologies like React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend ensures that the app is scalable, maintainable, and capable of delivering a seamless user experience. provide an in depth explanation of each component, and make it both accessible and technical\nChatGPT\nThe application comprises several interconnected components, each serving a distinct purpose within the chat interface ecosystem.

It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password. Session Management tracks the user's state (e.g. logged in) across multiple requests. Authorization decides what parts of the application the user is allowed to access. This page demonstrates how to use Next.js features to implement common authentication, authorization, and session management patterns so you can choose the best solutions based on your application's needs. Authentication\nAuthentication verifies a user's identity. This happens when a user logs in, either with a username and password or through a service like Google. It's all about confirming that users are really who they claim to be, protecting both the user's data and the application from unauthorized access or fraudulent activities. Authentication Strategies\nModern web applications commonly use several authentication strategies:\n\nOAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC): Enable third-party access without sharing user credentials. Ideal for social media logins and Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions. They add an identity layer with OpenID Connect. Credentials-based login (Email + Password): A standard choice for web applications, where users log in with an email and password. Familiar and easy to implement, it requires robust security measures against threats like phishing. Passwordless/Token-based authentication: Use email magic links or SMS one-time codes for secure, password-free access. Popular for its convenience and enhanced security, this method helps reduce password fatigue. Its limitation is the dependency on the user's email or phone availability. Passkeys/WebAuthn: Use cryptographic credentials unique to each site, offering high security against phishing. Secure but new, this strategy can be difficult to implement. Selecting an authentication strategy should align with your application's specific requirements, user interface considerations, and security objectives. Implementing Authentication\nIn this section, we'll explore the process of adding basic email-password authentication to a web application. While this method provides a fundamental level of security, it's worth considering more advanced options like OAuth or passwordless logins for enhanced protection against common security threats. The authentication flow we'll discuss is as follows:\n\nThe user submits their credentials through a login form. The form sends a request that is handled by an API route.

It's recommended to apply Middleware across all routes and specify exclusions for public access. Here's how to implement Middleware for authentication in Next.js:\n\nSetting Up Middleware:\nCreate a middleware.ts or .js file in your project's root directory. Include logic to authorize user access, such as checking for authentication tokens. Defining Protected Routes:\nNot all routes require authorization. Use the matcher option in your Middleware to specify any routes that do not require authorization checks. Middleware Logic:\nWrite logic to verify if a user is authenticated. Check user roles or permissions for route authorization. Handling Unauthorized Access:\nRedirect unauthorized users to a login or error page as appropriate. Example Middleware file:\n\nmiddleware.ts\n\nTypeScript\n\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const currentUser = request.cookies.get('currentUser')?.value\n \n  if (currentUser) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', request.url))\n  }\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)'],\n}\nThis example uses NextResponse.redirect for handling redirects early in the request pipeline, making it efficient and centralizing access control. After successful authentication, it's important to manage user navigation based on their roles. For example, an admin user might be redirected to an admin dashboard, while a regular user is sent to a different page. This is important for role-specific experiences and conditional navigation, such as prompting users to complete their profile if needed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"32352662-6177-4675-961c-032c14a2b102":{"id_":"32352662-6177-4675-961c-032c14a2b102","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/authentication-nextjs.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"gg7UaawN/Cui8tx1mmysrtymR4tAO9t8QQtaPRCn3p8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"403d84ca-6412-4e2b-8dbe-92674ae632e5","metadata":{},"hash":"CPsiMGU44NI8kx6LWAJIrNn5asHiUGdG5wbRz9q0P90="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1f9a0d98-78e4-48d1-bf08-8336f35897f2","metadata":{},"hash":"u8TBOX/OdvNVlogmaJ7d5rI8xIJSvxhZ68Lsu2y7sl0="}},"hash":"vS9CG190zEIhf8UCX8pjz50f9e8JcyoL3oaejqpbjuE=","text":"When setting up authorization, it's important to ensure that the main security checks happen where your app accesses or changes data. While Middleware can be useful for initial validation, it should not be the sole line of defense in protecting your data. The bulk of security checks should be performed in the Data Access Layer (DAL). Protecting API Routes\nAPI Routes in Next.js are essential for handling server-side logic and data management. It's crucial to secure these routes to ensure that only authorized users can access specific functionalities. This typically involves verifying the user's authentication status and their role-based permissions. Here's an example of securing an API Route:\n\npages/api/route.ts\n\nTypeScript\n\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const session = await getSession(req)\n \n  // Check if the user is authenticated\n  if (!session) {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'User is not authenticated',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n \n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'Unauthorized access: User does not have admin privileges.',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n \n  // Proceed with the route for authorized users\n  // ... implementation of the API Route\n}\nThis example demonstrates an API Route with a two-tier security check for authentication and authorization. It first checks for an active session, and then verifies if the logged-in user is an 'admin'. This approach ensures secure access, limited to authenticated and authorized users, maintaining robust security for request processing. Best Practices\nSecure Session Management: Prioritize the security of session data to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Use encryption and secure storage practices. Dynamic Role Management: Use a flexible system for user roles to easily adjust to changes in permissions and roles, avoiding hardcoded roles. Security-First Approach: In all aspects of authorization logic, prioritize security to safeguard user data and maintain the integrity of your application. This includes thorough testing and considering potential security vulnerabilities. Session Management\nSession management involves tracking and managing a user's interaction with the application over time, ensuring that their authenticated state is preserved across different parts of the application. This prevents the need for repeated logins, enhancing both security and user convenience.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1f9a0d98-78e4-48d1-bf08-8336f35897f2":{"id_":"1f9a0d98-78e4-48d1-bf08-8336f35897f2","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/authentication-nextjs.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"gg7UaawN/Cui8tx1mmysrtymR4tAO9t8QQtaPRCn3p8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"32352662-6177-4675-961c-032c14a2b102","metadata":{},"hash":"vS9CG190zEIhf8UCX8pjz50f9e8JcyoL3oaejqpbjuE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e348c9f5-a990-4f9c-9cd2-da74318c1c07","metadata":{},"hash":"44sXX3ZLUA1myL4k7+RYUTjcJMAkvh8Txs2xRrviIVY="}},"hash":"u8TBOX/OdvNVlogmaJ7d5rI8xIJSvxhZ68Lsu2y7sl0=","text":"This prevents the need for repeated logins, enhancing both security and user convenience. There are two primary methods used for session management: cookie-based and database sessions. Cookie-Based Sessions\n🎥 Watch: Learn more about cookie-based sessions and authentication with Next.js → YouTube (11 minutes). Cookie-based sessions manage user data by storing encrypted session information directly in browser cookies. Upon user login, this encrypted data is stored in the cookie. Each subsequent server request includes this cookie, minimizing the need for repeated server queries and enhancing client-side efficiency. However, this method requires careful encryption to protect sensitive data, as cookies are susceptible to client-side security risks. Encrypting session data in cookies is key to safeguarding user information from unauthorized access. It ensures that even if a cookie is stolen, the data inside remains unreadable. Additionally, while individual cookies are limited in size (typically around 4KB), techniques like cookie-chunking can overcome this limitation by dividing large session data into multiple cookies. Setting a cookie in a Next.js project might look something like this:\n\nSetting a cookie on the server:\n\npages/api/login.ts\n\nTypeScript\n\nimport { serialize } from 'cookie'\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const sessionData = req.body\n  const encryptedSessionData = encrypt(sessionData)\n \n  const cookie = serialize('session', encryptedSessionData, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',\n    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // One week\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', cookie)\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Successfully set cookie! ' })\n}\nDatabase Sessions\nDatabase session management involves storing session data on the server, with the user's browser only receiving a session ID. This ID references the session data stored server-side, without containing the data itself. This method enhances security, as it keeps sensitive session data away from the client-side environment, reducing the risk of exposure to client-side attacks. Database sessions are also more scalable, accommodating larger data storage needs. However, this approach has its tradeoffs. It can increase performance overhead due to the need for database lookups at each user interaction. Strategies like session data caching can help mitigate this.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e348c9f5-a990-4f9c-9cd2-da74318c1c07":{"id_":"e348c9f5-a990-4f9c-9cd2-da74318c1c07","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/authentication-nextjs.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"gg7UaawN/Cui8tx1mmysrtymR4tAO9t8QQtaPRCn3p8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1f9a0d98-78e4-48d1-bf08-8336f35897f2","metadata":{},"hash":"u8TBOX/OdvNVlogmaJ7d5rI8xIJSvxhZ68Lsu2y7sl0="}},"hash":"44sXX3ZLUA1myL4k7+RYUTjcJMAkvh8Txs2xRrviIVY=","text":"Strategies like session data caching can help mitigate this. Additionally, reliance on the database means that session management is as reliable as the database's performance and availability. Here's a simplified example of implementing database sessions in a Next.js application:\n\nCreating a Session on the Server:\n\npages/api/create-session.ts\n\nTypeScript\n\nimport db from '../../lib/db'\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const user = req.body\n    const sessionId = generateSessionId()\n    await db.insertSession({\n      sessionId,\n      userId: user.id,\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n    })\n \n    res.status(200).json({ sessionId })\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' })\n  }\n}\nSelecting Session Management in Next.js\nDeciding between cookie-based and database sessions in Next.js depends on your application's needs. Cookie-based sessions are simpler and suit smaller applications with lower server load but may offer less security. Database sessions, while more complex, provide better security and scalability, ideal for larger, data-sensitive applications. With authentication solutions such as NextAuth.js, session management becomes more efficient, using either cookies or database storage. This automation simplifies the development process, but it's important to understand the session management method used by your chosen solution. Ensure it aligns with your application's security and performance requirements. Regardless of your choice, prioritize security in your session management strategy. For cookie-based sessions, using secure and HTTP-only cookies is crucial to protect session data. For database sessions, regular backups and secure handling of session data are essential. Implementing session expiry and cleanup mechanisms is vital in both approaches to prevent unauthorized access and maintain application performance and reliability.

Early AI programs were capable of outperforming humans in certain discrete tasks. Almost \r\nimmediately after the invention of the programmable computer, AI could show super-human \r\nperformance on a highly formalized problem like finding the fastest path through a network of roads. It took longer for AI to reach superiority for problems requiring more creativity. In 1996, IBM’s \r\nDeep Blue AI program beat Gary Kasparov, the then-world champion in chess. These programs, \r\nwhile useful, were essentially one-trick-ponies—their intelligence was not general. Deep Blue had \r\nmassive arrays of processors that could only play chess. Algorithms for path finding could solve a \r\nmaze or route a car, but they could not paint a painting. 16. Starting in the late 2000s and early 2010s, an older algorithm called “deep learning” \r\nbecame practical to implement on low-cost hardware for the first time. This caused an almost \r\novernight revolution in performance across nearly all AI projects. New, top of class algorithms were \r\ndeveloped for turning speech into text, translating between languages, and recognizing what kind of \r\nfood is shown in a photo. One of the hallmarks of deep learning is that algorithms do not need to be \r\ndesigned with significant knowledge of the task at hand. They learn each task from training \r\nexamples, essentially programming themselves. This means that they are far more general-purpose \r\nthan earlier systems like Deep Blue. 17. As deep learning algorithms became increasingly sophisticated, some of the world’s \r\nleading AI researchers set their sights on what has come to be called Artificial General Intelligence \r\n(AGI). The basic concept of AGI is a general purpose artificial intelligence system—a machine \r\nhaving intelligence for a wide variety of tasks like a human. 18. Mr. Musk has long recognized that AGI poses a grave threat to humanity—perhaps \r\nthe greatest existential threat we face today.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"963bc812-1a62-46ad-a0eb-d47ab8f7de8f":{"id_":"963bc812-1a62-46ad-a0eb-d47ab8f7de8f","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"W9TkCmLPxTjZzDrC9M1PlXRxytqq+KUS8TuANMhoj+M=","metadata":{},"hash":"ioZC9/9VkUv1WhVEy+P2zy/yI7P+Le70s8Hakx/aHVg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"78c7d984-7d27-44a1-bb8a-75c6944843b5","metadata":{},"hash":"0L9Q2BSnm8HbcPbDQksAP6MwXeSpsetS+hzvjHY5Aho="}},"hash":"72fRVM0pUxnc2ptvsttoLrn3hbdYCHMhVGjPXwwhn7U=","text":"His concerns mirrored those raised before him by \r\nluminaries like Stephen Hawking and Sun Microsystems founder Bill Joy.

But where some like Mr. Musk see an existential threat in AGI, others see AGI as a \r\nsource of profit and power. 20. In 2014, Google acquired DeepMind, a research group focused on deep learning. One of DeepMind’s initial developments was AlphaZero, a chess playing algorithm. Unlike \r\nprevious algorithms, however, AlphaZero used “reinforcement learning,” wherein the program \r\nlearns to play chess by playing itself with different versions of the software. It starts by playing \r\nrandomly, with no understanding of the game’s strategy. When one version of the software wins a \r\ngame against another, the winning program’s internal pathways are “reinforced” and the process \r\nrepeats. 21. AlphaZero rapidly became the strongest chess playing system in the world. Shockingly, it was also announced that the same program was also the strongest in the world for \r\nplaying two other extremely difficult games. In Google/DeepMind’s words, “Starting from random \r\nplay, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours \r\na superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and \r\nconvincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case. ” \r\n22. With the DeepMind team, Google immediately catapulted to the front of the race for \r\nAGI. Mr. Musk was deeply troubled by this development. He believed (and still does) that in the \r\nhands of a closed, for-profit company like Google, AGI poses a particularly acute and noxious \r\ndanger to humanity. In 2014, it was already difficult enough to compete with Google in its core \r\nbusinesses. Google had collected a uniquely large set of data from our searches, our emails, and \r\nnearly every book in our libraries.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"f9b3c86a-321c-4818-9b36-6e536abb60c2":{"id_":"f9b3c86a-321c-4818-9b36-6e536abb60c2","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"0nljpKTa8CQlIc7XT+U75qVq9+D0XdjEYX+AEORbvJg=","metadata":{},"hash":"W5s8Nd+PaC7rSn55JmGdW43mPejW7IkgOR0GDf/GQ/E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4aab5f80-b798-4075-964f-d9c6016372d4","metadata":{},"hash":"GpaU57pA/4Y4QNrG0U71YScjoqINOZU3ABtfBjCgR6c="}},"hash":"LLa3Q5c0Np/fsC2pjujokaGxJyX5TDNKEqNYl8EbB5g=","text":"Nevertheless, up to this point, everyone had the potential to \r\ncompete with Google through superior human intelligence and hard work.

Together with Mr. Brockman, the three agreed that this new lab: (a) would be a non-\r\nprofit developing AGI for the benefit of humanity, not for a for-profit company seeking to maximize \r\nshareholder profits; and (b) would be open-source, balancing only countervailing safety \r\nconsiderations, and would not keep its technology closed and secret for proprietary commercial \r\nreasons (The “Founding Agreement”). Reflecting the Founding Agreement, Mr. Musk named this \r\nnew AI lab “OpenAI,” which would compete with, and serve as a vital counterbalance to, \r\nGoogle/DeepMind in the race for AGI, but would do so to benefit humanity, not the shareholders \r\nof a private, for-profit company (much less one of the largest technology companies in the world). 25.

These communities spread to open-source, grass-roots efforts and \r\ncommercial entities alike. 28. Mr. Altman became OpenAI, Inc.’s CEO in 2019. On September 22, 2020, OpenAI \r\nentered into an agreement with Microsoft, exclusively licensing to Microsoft its Generative Pre-\r\nTrained Transformer (GPT)-3 language model. However, OpenAI published a detailed paper \r\ndescribing the internals and training data for GPT-3, enabling the community to create similar \r\nmodels themselves.

He warned that unless safeguards were put in place, “artificial intelligence-systems \r\nmight replace humans, making our species irrelevant or even extinct. ” Mr. Page responded that \r\nwould merely “be the next stage of evolution,” and claimed Mr. Musk was being a “specist”—that","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"a92c31f3-34ef-4d5d-9b85-8f98b9ab10d1":{"id_":"a92c31f3-34ef-4d5d-9b85-8f98b9ab10d1","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"edyeJYMSBLOo2wc3ozcoQbzlFkZAau6cPiJBbJsraqk=","metadata":{},"hash":"OKc8+2f3fb1IqoQjEjTX5E4ShMF2l0Ub1XZAdfgjA4E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fca28298-b547-4f2a-ba09-44c097df0721","metadata":{},"hash":"jWHJpHUCbSbKMzBizS3JCLBTNzX/UwRG6WCw0PZfLKs="}},"hash":"VPr4fpCTpNd9YxvFeA0IHAniCDWTbck/rAnNufu6leg=","text":"1 \r\n2 \r\n3 \r\n4 \r\n5 \r\n6 \r\n7 \r\n8 \r\n9 \r\n10 \r\n11 \r\n12 \r\n13 \r\n14 \r\n15 \r\n16 \r\n17 \r\n18 \r\n19 \r\n20 \r\n21 \r\n22 \r\n23 \r\n24 \r\n25 \r\n26 \r\n27 \r\n28 \r\n \r\n \r\n– 10 – \r\nCOMPLAINT \r\n \r\nhe favored the human species over intelligent machines. Mr. Musk responded, “Well, yes, I am pro-\r\nhuman. ” \r\n37. At the end of 2013, Mr. Musk learned to his grave concern that Google was planning \r\nto acquire DeepMind. At the time, DeepMind was one of the most advanced AI companies in the \r\nindustry. Thus, Mr. Musk was deeply concerned that DeepMind’s AI technology would be in the \r\nhands of someone who viewed it and its power so cavalierly, and could hide its design and \r\ncapabilities behind closed doors. 38. In an effort to prevent this powerful technology from falling into Google’s hands, \r\nMr. Musk and Luke Nosek, a co-founder of PayPal, attempted to put together funding to buy \r\nDeepMind. This effort culminated in an hour-long call wherein Mr. Musk and Mr. Nosek made one \r\nlast effort to convince Mr. Hassabis not to sell DeepMind to Google. Mr. Musk told Mr. Hassabis \r\nthat “[t]he future of AI should not be controlled by Larry [Page]. ”  \r\n39. Mr. Musk and Mr. Nosek’s effort was unsuccessful. It was reported in January 2014 \r\nthat DeepMind would be acquired by Google. However, this did not deter Mr. Musk from continuing \r\nto ensure that AI was developed and practiced safely. 40. Following Google’s acquisition of DeepMind, Mr. Musk began “hosting his own \r\nseries of dinner discussions on ways to counter Google and promote AI safety. ” Mr. Musk also \r\nreached out to President Barack Obama to discuss AI and AI safety. In 2015, Mr. Musk and \r\nPresident Obama had a meeting during which Mr. Musk explained the dangers of AI and advocated \r\nfor regulation. Mr. Musk felt that President Obama understood the dangers of AI, but regulation \r\nnever came. 41.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"fca28298-b547-4f2a-ba09-44c097df0721":{"id_":"fca28298-b547-4f2a-ba09-44c097df0721","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"edyeJYMSBLOo2wc3ozcoQbzlFkZAau6cPiJBbJsraqk=","metadata":{},"hash":"OKc8+2f3fb1IqoQjEjTX5E4ShMF2l0Ub1XZAdfgjA4E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a92c31f3-34ef-4d5d-9b85-8f98b9ab10d1","metadata":{},"hash":"VPr4fpCTpNd9YxvFeA0IHAniCDWTbck/rAnNufu6leg="}},"hash":"jWHJpHUCbSbKMzBizS3JCLBTNzX/UwRG6WCw0PZfLKs=","text":"41.

Mr. Altman appeared to share Mr. Musk’s concerns surrounding AI. In public blog \r\nposts dating back to 2014, Mr. Altman stated that AGI, if made, would “be the biggest development \r\nin technology ever. ” Mr. Altman pointed out that there are many companies making strides towards \r\nachieving AGI, but acknowledged the unfortunate reality that the “good ones are very secretive \r\nabout it. ” \r\n44. On February 25, 2015, Mr. Altman also expressed his concern surrounding the \r\ndevelopment of what he referred to as “superhuman machine intelligence” which he identified as \r\n“probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity” and emphasized that “as a \r\nhuman programmed to survive and reproduce, I feel we should fight it. ” Further, Mr. Altman \r\ncriticized those who believed that “superhuman machine intelligence” was dangerous but dismissed \r\nit as “never going to happen or definitely very far off. ” He accused them of engaging in “sloppy, \r\ndangerous thinking. ” \r\n45. Indeed, in early March 2015, Mr. Altman extolled the importance of government \r\nregulation as a means to ensure AI is created safely and suggested that “a group of very smart people \r\nwith a lot of resources” likely involving “US companies in some way” would be the most probable \r\ngroup to achieve “superhuman machine intelligence” first. 46. Later that month, Mr. Altman reached out to Mr. Musk to inquire whether he would \r\nbe interested in drafting an open letter to the United States Government regarding AI. The two began \r\npreparing a letter and approaching those of influence in the technology and AI sectors about signing.

I think the answer \r\nis almost definitely not. If it’s going to happen, it seems like it would be good for someone other \r\nthan Google to do it first. ” Mr. Altman had an idea: that Y Combinator start a “Manhattan Project” \r\nfor AI. (Unfortunately, it turns out that the “Manhattan Project” is a moniker that may be all too \r\napt. ) He proposed that “we could structure it so that the tech belongs to the world via some sort of \r\nnonprofit but the people working on it get startup-like compensation if it works. Obviously we’d \r\ncomply with/aggressively support all regulation. ” Mr. Musk responded, “Probably worth a \r\nconversation. ” \r\n51. After further communications, Mr. Altman emailed Mr. Musk on June 24, 2015 with \r\na detailed proposal for this new “AI lab. ” “The mission would be to create the first general AI and \r\nuse it for individual empowerment—ie, the distributed version of the future that seems the safest.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ef470b02-9abb-48a3-907e-f4c163b58965":{"id_":"ef470b02-9abb-48a3-907e-f4c163b58965","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"Ej9jViFo7BtdXQCevKlMsMcSLoIAZck5PJ1kkqSfyvs=","metadata":{},"hash":"/xKVjce22badlJBRV2JB+JGLNHQCnjxdAu6KuamJygE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d476a29f-b4b3-4e96-9bbc-4fe1d91c4878","metadata":{},"hash":"NXSrM9SqBxS7Q0awGlVeHBJVp95d5+QqLFgj9VfiYpQ="}},"hash":"kHgqpXXh3Hz7TzLLzCMQtkD7YwIAvgeFrXvotmfbkD0=","text":"More generally, safety should be a first-class requirement. ” “The technology would be owned by \r\nthe foundation and used ‘for the good of the world’[. ]” He proposed that they start with a group of \r\n7-10 people and expand from there.

Mr. Musk came up with the name of the new lab, a name reflecting the Founding \r\nAgreement: “Open AI Institute,” or simply, “OpenAI. ”  \r\n55. With these principles of the Founding Agreement in mind, Mr. Musk joined forces \r\nwith Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman to formalize and launch the project.

OpenAI, Inc. was publicly announced on December 11, 2015. In the announcement, \r\nMr. Musk and Mr. Altman were named as co-chairs and Mr. Brockman was named as the CTO. The \r\nannouncement emphasized that OpenAI was designed to “benefit humanity,” and its research would \r\nbe “free from financial obligation”: \r\nOpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company. Our goal is to \r\nadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a \r\nwhole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is \r\nfree from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact. Ex. 3 at 1. C. Mr. Musk’s Crucial Role In Getting OpenAI, Inc. Off The Ground \r\n58.

OpenAI, L.L.C. was formed in Delaware on September 17, \r\n2020. OpenAI, L.L.C.’s sole member is OpenAI OpCo, LLC. 71. OpenAI OpCo, LLC was formed in Delaware on September 19, 2018, and its sole \r\nmember is OpenAI Global, LLC. 72. OpenAI Global, LLC was formed in Delaware on December 28, 2022. On \r\ninformation and belief, OpenAI Global, LLC, like OpenAI, L.P., is a capped for-profit entity. OpenAI Global, LLC has two members: Microsoft Corporation and OAI Corporation, LLC. 73. OAI Corporation, LLC is a limited liability company formed in Delaware. The sole \r\nmember of OAI Corporation, LLC is OpenAI Holdings, LLC. 74. OpenAI Holdings, LLC was formed in Delaware on March 17, 2023, and has \r\nmultiple members including OpenAI, Inc., Aestas, LLC, and various individual members. 75.

Meanwhile, at Google, an algorithm called the Transformer was created that solved \r\nmany of the issues deep learning had faced in understanding long sequences of text. This algorithm, \r\nan example of a “large-language model,” was developed to translate text from one language to \r\nanother and works by forming connections between words in the source language and mapping \r\nthose connections to the target language. 79. Researchers at OpenAI continued this research and quickly produced yet another \r\nstartling result: by using the first half of Google’s Transformer architecture, a deep neural network \r\ncould be pre-trained on a large corpus of text and used to generate new text. In January 2018, \r\nOpenAI released the source code and trained model for this Generative Pre-Trained Transformer \r\n(GPT) along with a detailed paper describing the model and its capabilities  \r\n80. In 2019, OpenAI released a second-generation model, GPT-2. The release was again \r\naccompanied by a detailed paper describing the model and noting that unlike previous models, \r\nwhich needed to be trained on a specific task, “[w]hen a large language model is trained on a \r\nsufficiently large and diverse dataset it is able to perform well across many domains and datasets. ” \r\nThese models were proving themselves to be very different from previous AI systems. Instead of \r\ntraining the system to perform a particular task, they could be simply “asked” to perform a new task \r\nin natural language. 81. As contemplated by the Founding Agreement, OpenAI publicly released the full \r\nversion of GPT-2. Notably, it did so despite the fact that “humans find GPT-2 outputs convincing,” \r\nthat “GPT-2 can be fine-tuned for misuse,” and that “detection [of GPT generated text] is \r\nchallenging.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"87f18204-3f8b-4c73-b801-0ad756f32501":{"id_":"87f18204-3f8b-4c73-b801-0ad756f32501","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"R68d/SN2rRXfjBVwd0OhQP/RWP9XxBTwCYA0jOST6aM=","metadata":{},"hash":"jzOg+tZL3qsnCYFKxERke72sBCfVoxFymceNX6tWqLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a6ef773b-4e3d-4877-bab8-42812e95ea76","metadata":{},"hash":"wQCeXVY8rLap/x5CgLK+VF0v1Y9f3NSfRyvm0TI+N7g="}},"hash":"Ot+XLxZelE7qh8ciYkJVVO/qFJyrtNB8O6vwCYJQZAE=","text":"” At the time, OpenAI stated that it was releasing the full, open version with the hope \r\nthat it “will be useful to developers of future powerful models. ” This release was accompanied by a \r\ndetailed paper co-authored by OpenAI scientists as well as independent social and technical \r\nscientists.

Their publication did prove to be useful to the developers of future, powerful models. Entire communities sprung up to enhance and extend the models released by OpenAI. These \r\ncommunities spread to open-source, grass-roots efforts and commercial entities alike. 83. In 2020, OpenAI announced a third version of its model, GPT-3. It used “175 billion \r\nparameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model. ” Again, OpenAI announced \r\nthe development of this model with the publication of a research paper describing its complete \r\nimplementation for others to build on. 84. In 2022, researchers at Google took these results and showed that a small change \r\ncalled chain-of-thought prompting could enable “large language models to perform complex \r\nreasoning. ” Researchers at the University of Tokyo and Google quickly expanded on Google’s \r\nresults and showed that OpenAI’s GPT-3 could reason about an entirely new problem in a step-by-\r\nstep manner, like a human, “by simply adding ‘Let’s think step by step’ before each answer. ”  \r\n85. A path to Artificial Generative Intelligence could be seen. And the timeline to it was \r\ndramatically compressing. 86. On March 14, 2023, OpenAI released a new generation of its model, GPT-4. This \r\ngeneration was not just capable of reasoning but was better at reasoning than average humans. GPT-4 scored in the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam. It scored in the 99th percentile on \r\nthe GRE Verbal Assessment. It even scored a 77% on the Advanced Sommelier examination. By \r\nOpenAI’s own objective measures, GPT-4 is already capable of intelligence that is superior to \r\nhumans on a wide variety of economically valuable tasks. 87.

This safeguard was put in place for the Board in furtherance of OpenAI, \r\nInc.’s non-profit mission and the Founding Agreement: to safely create AGI which would benefit \r\nhumanity, not the pecuniary interests of a for-profit company. 98. On information and belief, Mr. Altman’s firing was due in part to OpenAI’s \r\nbreakthrough in realizing AGI. In fact, news reports suggested that there was a rift among OpenAI \r\nBoard members and executives regarding safety concerns and the potential threat posed by \r\nOpenAI’s next generation Q*. 99. News of Mr. Altman’s ouster spread rapidly. Following the Board’s announcement \r\nthat Mr. Altman was fired, Mr. Brockman announced he would be leaving OpenAI with Mr. Altman. 100. When Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella learned of Mr. Altman’s firing, he was \r\nreportedly furious. As a 49% shareholder in OpenAI’s for-profit arm, Mr. Nadella felt that Microsoft \r\nshould have been consulted before Mr. Altman’s firing. However, at this time, outside of Mr. Altman, OpenAI, Inc.’s Board had no ties to Microsoft, and no fiduciary duty to investors in the for-\r\nprofit arm. Rather, on information and belief, Mr. Altman was the primary liaison between \r\nMicrosoft and OpenAI, Inc. 101. Mr. Nadella invited Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman to lead a new Microsoft AI \r\nresearch lab, unbound by the constraints of OpenAI, Inc.’s humanitarian mission.

Despite Microsoft’s statements regarding their capability to function without \r\nOpenAI, Microsoft never abandoned its plan to secure the reinstatement of Mr. Altman as OpenAI, \r\nInc.’s CEO. In the days following Mr. Altman’s firing, OpenAI, Inc.’s Board was faced with \r\nmounting pressure from lawyers and major shareholders, including Microsoft, to reinstate Mr. Altman. 104. Ms. Toner was specifically targeted in efforts to reinstate Mr. Altman. During these \r\nefforts, a lawyer for OpenAI told Ms. Toner that she and the Board could face claims for breach of \r\ntheir fiduciary duties to investors should OpenAI fail due to Mr. Altman’s firing. 105. However, the OpenAI, Inc. Board has never had a fiduciary duty to investors. In fact, \r\nall investors in the for-profit arm are told that the company’s duty to its mission takes precedence \r\nover its duty to its investors, and OpenAI, Inc.’s website clearly indicates it only holds a fiduciary \r\nduty to humanity. 106. Ms. Toner, who described the lawyer’s actions as an intimidation tactic, opined that \r\nMr. Altman’s continued removal would in fact advance the company’s mission by promoting the \r\nsafety of humanity over profit. However, none of this dissuaded the shareholders and Mr. Altman \r\nfrom pushing for his reinstatement. 107. Further, Microsoft had substantial coercive power over OpenAI, Inc. and its Board. During the period of Mr. Altman’s firing, CEO Nadella said the following of Microsoft’s \r\nrelationship with OpenAI: \r\nWe are in there. We are below them, above them, around them. We do the kernel \r\noptimizations, we build tools, we build the infrastructure.

One of Mr. Altman’s conditions upon return was that Ms. Toner, Ms. McCauley, \r\nand Dr. Sutskever resign from the Board. 110. On information and belief, following his return, Mr. Altman hand-picked a new \r\nBoard that lacks similar technical expertise or any substantial background in AI governance, which \r\nthe previous board had by design. Mr. D’Angelo, a tech CEO and entrepreneur, was the only \r\nmember of the previous board to remain after Mr. Altman’s return. The new Board consisted of \r\nmembers with more experience in profit-centric enterprises or politics than in AI ethics and \r\ngovernance. They were also reportedly “big fans of Altman. ” Two of the new board members were \r\nBret Taylor and Larry Summers. Mr. Taylor is no stranger to Silicon Valley, and has been heavily \r\ninvolved in various Bay Area profit-driven ventures. On February 14, 2024, Mr. Taylor and ex-\r\nGoogle executive Clay Bavor launched a startup focused on building AI chatbots for businesses. Dr. Summers is an economist who, on information and belief, had no experience working in artificial \r\nintelligence-based ventures prior to November 2023. Microsoft also obtained an observer seat on \r\nthe Board from which it could keep a close eye on its ostensibly non-profit golden goose. 111. With the reinstatement of Mr. Altman and the restructuring of the Board, OpenAI’s \r\ncorporate structure that had been designed as a system of checks and balances between the non-\r\nprofit arm, for-profit arm, the Board, and the CEO to ensure the non-profit mission was being carried \r\nout, collapsed overnight. OpenAI, Inc.’s once carefully crafted non-profit structure was replaced by \r\na purely profit-driven CEO and a Board with inferior technical expertise in AGI and AI public \r\npolicy.

To the contrary, OpenAI’s attainment of AGI, like \r\n“Tomorrow” in Annie, will always be a day away, ensuring that Microsoft will be licensed to \r\nOpenAI’s latest technology and the public will be shut out, precisely the opposite of the Founding \r\nAgreement. 113. OpenAI’s conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley and, if allowed \r\nto stand, could represent a paradigm shift for technology start-ups. It is important to reflect on what \r\nhas transpired here: a non-profit startup has collected tens of millions of dollars in contributions for \r\nthe express purpose of developing AGI technology for public benefit, and shortly before achieving \r\nthe very milestone that the company was created to achieve, the company has become a closed, for-\r\nprofit partner of the world’s largest corporation, thereby personally enriching the Defendants. If this \r\nbusiness model were valid, it would radically redefine how venture capitalism is practiced in \r\nCalifornia and beyond. Rather than start out as a for-profit entity from the outset, “smart” investors \r\nwould establish non-profits, use pre-tax donations to fund research and development, and then once \r\ntheir technology had been developed and proven, would slide the resulting IP assets into a new for-\r\nprofit venture to enrich themselves and their profit-maximizing corporate partners. That is not \r\nsupposed to be how the law works in California or anywhere else in this country, and this should \r\nnot be the first Court to hold otherwise. 114. To further understand why this is important, if OpenAI’s new business model is \r\nvalid, for every dollar that an investor “invests” by contributing to a non-profit, that investor gets \r\napproximately 50 cents back from the state and federal governments in the form of reduced income \r\ntaxes, so the net cost to them of each $1 of investment is only 50 cents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"095f3f9f-454a-452c-8a04-007bed8044a7":{"id_":"095f3f9f-454a-452c-8a04-007bed8044a7","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"fju2b2RljBAZdxBMqfrgcmMhFxTlf6SKO4TMMIS4zOk=","metadata":{},"hash":"gU+AVKMHNkYC/6602jEWFKtEGGv5nt8bg/jrbDmllCM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fb3410f5-c817-40e8-a8c4-7f87c2973903","metadata":{},"hash":"WoX1NFotYTL1f5uQGT4L4xqY4p1C5FcbCoHvD0l91LM="}},"hash":"VT2RuANmSG9ZCQ9JAfd6wVf0F7Qq4xERyVYt4mF6YiE=","text":"However, with OpenAI’s \r\nnew business model, they get the same “for profit” upside as those who invest the conventional way \r\nin for-profit corporations and thus do not get an immediate tax write off, financed by the government \r\nand, ultimately, the public.

The public is still in the dark regarding what exactly the Board’s “deliberative review \r\nprocess” revealed that resulted in the initial firing of Mr. Altman. However, one thing is clear to Mr. Musk and the public at large: OpenAI has abandoned its “irrevocable” non-profit mission in the \r\npursuit of profit. Numerous leaders and intellectuals have publicly commented on the irony and \r\ntragedy of OpenAI becoming “Closed, For-Profit AI. ” \r\n116. For example, on November 29, 2023, MIT economists wrote an opinion in the L.A. Times expressing concern with OpenAI’s new profit-driven directive. In their words, “[d]isruption \r\nand uncontrolled growth have become religion for the tech industry, and Altman has been one of its \r\nmost dedicated high priests. ” The economists emphasized the new Board is far more likely to allow \r\nMr. Altman to scale up OpenAI as quickly as possible, no matter the severity of societal costs. 117. The president of Public Citizen, a non-profit consumer advocacy organization, wrote \r\nan open letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta earlier this year raising concerns about \r\nwhether OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary is exerting inappropriate control over the non-profit, or \r\nwhether the non-profit’s purpose had shifted to profit-making under Mr. Altman and Microsoft. The \r\nletter suggested that should the non-profit abandon its original mission, it should be dissolved with \r\nproceeds going to another charitable enterprise. 118.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"5b6cdfbe-54f8-48da-9c10-0bc43ebd2cce":{"id_":"5b6cdfbe-54f8-48da-9c10-0bc43ebd2cce","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"NjN3TZZVkHuQp0nCVqASDVU0N4plYatvqS3CCN1rHSY=","metadata":{},"hash":"CDI/MDgS+9yoQqJN/tncIu9h+lP6E+nMOjhqncHfFYg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1358fdb2-f51f-4125-8cb4-ac036ac51e7a","metadata":{},"hash":"byW5QIV0Xkf4zSulwQrXOVmTFMr1yr8nBxSoilx04i4="}},"hash":"vyyw5jyL6rNgU7sr0da7GngPvW6cs+lJWIOOrqwynsc=","text":"118.

Access to OpenAI’s documents could inform the public whether it has changed its \r\ngovernance to appease Microsoft and other shareholders. At the very least, changes had to be made \r\nto accommodate Microsoft’s seat on the Board, and now Mr. Altman is reportedly in discussions \r\nwith Middle Eastern investors to raise up to $7 trillion in an effort develop a global network of AI \r\nchip fabrication plants. If $10 billion from Microsoft was enough to get it a seat on the Board, one \r\ncan only imagine how much influence over OpenAI, Inc. these new potential investments could \r\nconfer on the investors. This is especially troubling when one potential donor is the national security \r\nadvisor of the United Arab Emirates, and United States officials are concerned due to the United \r\nArab Emirates’ ties to China. Moreover, Mr. Altman has been quoted discussing the possibility of \r\nmaking the United Arab Emirates a “regulatory sandbox” where AI technologies are tested. 120. Further, access to OpenAI’s conflict-of-interest policy is important to shed light on \r\nthe Board’s ability to control Mr. Altman’s use of OpenAI to advance his own economic interests, \r\nwhich so far appear to have gone unchecked. For example, in 2019 when Mr. Altman was CEO, \r\nOpenAI signed a letter of intent to buy $51 million worth of chips from a start-up in which Mr. Altman was heavily invested. 121. While OpenAI, Inc. was once a pioneer of safe, responsible development of AGI \r\nbased on open communication with the public, it has now shut its doors, brought the biggest investor \r\nof its for-profit subsidiary onto a Board which owes its only fiduciary duty to humanity, and \r\ncontinues in secrecy towards a profit-centric future with possible calamitous implications for \r\nhumanity. 122.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference only paragraphs of this Complaint \r\nnecessary for his claim of Breach of Contract. 124. From OpenAI, Inc.’s founding in 2015 through September 2020, Plaintiff \r\ncontributed tens of millions of dollars, provided integral advice on research directions, and played \r\na key role in recruiting world-class talent to OpenAI, Inc. in exchange and as consideration for the \r\nFounding Agreement, namely, that: OpenAI, Inc. (a) would be a non-profit developing AGI for the \r\nbenefit of humanity, not for a for-profit company seeking to maximize shareholder profits; and \r\n(b) would be open-source, balancing only countervailing safety considerations, and would not keep \r\nits technology closed and secret for proprietary commercial reasons. This Founding Agreement is \r\nmemorialized in, among other places, OpenAI, Inc.’s founding Articles of Incorporation and in \r\nnumerous written communications between Plaintiff and Defendants over a multi-year period, \r\nsuch as: \r\na. “The specific purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research, \r\ndevelopment and distribution of technology related to artificial intelligence. The \r\nresulting technology will benefit the public and the corporation will seek to open \r\nsource technology for the public benefit when applicable. The corporation is not \r\norganized for the private gain of any person. ” Ex. 1 at 1. b. Mr. Altman stated: “The mission would be to create the first general AI and use it \r\nfor individual empowerment—ie, the distributed version of the future that seems the \r\nsafest.

Licensing GPT-4, which Microsoft’s own scientists have written can “reasonably \r\nbe viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general \r\nintelligence (AGI) system,” exclusively to Microsoft, despite agreeing that OpenAI \r\nwould develop AGI for the benefit of humanity, not for the private commercial gain \r\nof a for-profit company seeking to maximize shareholder profits, much less the \r\nlargest corporation in the world. b. Failing to disclose to the public, among other things, details on GPT-4’s \r\narchitecture, hardware, training method, and training computation, and further by \r\nerecting a “paywall” between the public and GPT-4, requiring per-token payment \r\nfor usage, in order to advance Defendants and Microsoft’s own private commercial \r\ninterests, despite agreeing that OpenAI’s technology would be open-source, \r\nbalancing only countervailing safety considerations. c.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ breaches, Plaintiff has suffered \r\ndamages in an amount that is presently unknown, but that substantially exceeds this Court’s \r\njurisdictional minimum of $35,000, and, if necessary, will be proven at trial. 127.

In order to induce Plaintiff to make millions of dollars in contributions to OpenAI, \r\nInc. over a period of years, and to induce him to provide substantial time and other resources to get \r\nOpenAI, Inc. off the ground as alleged herein, Defendants repeatedly promised Plaintiff, including \r\nin writing, that OpenAI (a) would be a non-profit developing AGI for the benefit of humanity, not \r\nfor a for-profit company seeking to maximize shareholder profits; and (b) would be open-source, \r\nbalancing only countervailing safety considerations, and would not keep its technology closed and \r\nsecret for proprietary commercial reasons. 130. In doing so, Defendants reasonably expected that Plaintiff would (as he did) rely on \r\ntheir promises and provide funding, time and other resources to OpenAI, Inc. 131.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference only paragraphs of this Complaint \r\nnecessary for his claim of Breach of Fiduciary Duty. 134. Under California law, Defendants owe fiduciary duties to Plaintiff, including a duty \r\nto use Plaintiff’s contributions for the purposes for which they were made. E.g., Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17510.8. Defendants have repeatedly breached their fiduciary duties to Plaintiff, including \r\nby:  \r\na. Using monies received from Plaintiff, and by using intellectual property and \r\nderivative works funded by those monies, for “for-profit” purposes that directly \r\ncontravene both the letter and the express intent of the parties’ agreement, thereby \r\nbreaching Defendants’ contractual promises to Plaintiff, and also breaching \r\nDefendants’ promises to the express intended third-party beneficiaries of the \r\nparties’ agreement, i.e., the public. For example, Defendants caused GPT-4, which \r\nMicrosoft’s own scientists have written can “reasonably be viewed as an early (yet \r\nstill incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system,” to be \r\nexclusively licensed to Microsoft, in derogation of OpenAI, Inc.’s irrevocable non-\r\nprofit mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity. b.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \r\nAccounting  \r\nAgainst All Defendants \r\n145. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference only paragraphs of this Complaint \r\nnecessary for his claim of Accounting. 146. As discussed above, over the course of multiple years, Defendants solicited tens of \r\nmillions of dollars in donations from Plaintiff with representations and assurances that OpenAI, Inc. would remain a non-profit irrevocably dedicated to creating safe AGI for public benefit, and that all \r\ndonated funds would be used in accordance with that “irrevocable” mandate. On information and \r\nbelief, Defendants also solicited tens of millions of dollars in donations from others based on the \r\nsame representations. 147. Contrary to the express purpose for which Plaintiff’s funds were contributed, as set \r\nforth herein, Defendants used monies received from Plaintiff, and intellectual property and \r\nderivative works funded by those monies, for “for-profit” purposes, including for the benefit of \r\nprivate individuals and likely of the individual Defendants themselves, that directly contravene both \r\nthe letter and the express intent of the parties’ agreement. 148. Because Defendants are in possession of financial information relating to the use of \r\nthe charitable contributions that Plaintiff and others made to OpenAI, Inc. and the intellectual \r\nproperty and derivative works funded by those monies, Plaintiff is presently unable to ascertain his \r\ninterest in or the use, allocation, or distribution of assets without an accounting. Plaintiff is therefore \r\nentitled to an accounting.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"bf936742-553a-4b20-8ba6-8ef046707c09":{"id_":"bf936742-553a-4b20-8ba6-8ef046707c09","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"q6b9YMu9gV1hbDGhemL3+Y0kWX7haqd3vT61kVBDGP0=","metadata":{},"hash":"eJJqXklWsjPVy/6s48XKxD+YSFllLb18waJsuyuHG6E="}},"hash":"foqg6VvfQi7OMKaEY9fjv+4AYhbnHvulJGkzbdO3YHs=","text":"1 \r\n2 \r\n3 \r\n4 \r\n5 \r\n6 \r\n7 \r\n8 \r\n9 \r\n10 \r\n11 \r\n12 \r\n13 \r\n14 \r\n15 \r\n16 \r\n17 \r\n18 \r\n19 \r\n20 \r\n21 \r\n22 \r\n23 \r\n24 \r\n25 \r\n26 \r\n27 \r\n28 \r\n \r\n \r\n– 34 – \r\nCOMPLAINT \r\n \r\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \r\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendants as follows: \r\nA.
